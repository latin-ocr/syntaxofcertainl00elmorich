junctive3 otherwise it would stand entirely without parallel. This is
not lil<e1y3 and taking into account the form and the 32 cases of the
subjunctive under precisely the same conditions, it is impossible to
doubt that noris belongs in the same syntactical category with them.
It was only the failure to recognize the existence of this category
that raised the question in ihe first place concerning this word.

CHAPTER V.

It is the purpose of this chapter to consider certain uses of some
of the verbs of our group without reference to the construction
which depends upon them. Iwill begin under this head with the
use of velle in questions as seen in the formulas vin tu or visne tu,
and vis tu.

Notwithstanding the iact that these forms of interrogation occur
almost exclusively in the comic poets, the discussion as to their
meaning has centered mainly about the two well known passages in
Hor„ Sat. Ι. 9. 69: Vin tu curtis Iudaeis oppedere? and Sat. 2. C). 92:
Vis tu homines urbemque feris praeponere silvis? As the text stands
land it is the consensus of the Keller and Holder Mss. except that
in Sat. 1. 9. 69, y has vis) the question in the first passage has
certainly the force of a warning or at least is an expression of
dissuasion, while the second question is equivalent to an exhortation.
In his note on Sat. 2. 6. 92, Lambinus proposed sor vis to read vin,
which he found in several Mss, accessible to him and which 116
thought to be more suitable in meaning. This view was vigorously
opposed by Bentley who following Gronovius in the latter's discussion
of vis tu in certain passages of Seneca¹ says: “Vis non interrogantis
modo ut vin, sed orantis hortantis flagitantis, iubentis,” Later com-
mentators have to a large extent, fallen in with Bentley’s formulation.
Thus in the revised edition of Orelli we read: duae sunt formulae
visne tu sive vin tu, et vis tu. Illa est dissuadentis et dehortantis, haec
adhortantis et suadentis.” This position, especially in so far as it
relates to vin tu is also held by Duentzer, Schutz, Kirchener, Kiess-
ling, Ritter, and Kirldand, the last named editor saying of vin tu:
“This form usually tends toward the negative pole, vis tu toward the
affirmative3 the one expresses a warning‚ the other an exhortation·‚
translate: Surely you will not insult the circumcised Jews.''
