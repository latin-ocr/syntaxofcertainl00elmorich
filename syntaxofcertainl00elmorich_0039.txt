(18].)θῦόὸ on the field from which the examples are taken. For Comcdy
Madvig-'s statement is wholly unfmmdcd'. Herc (except with nolle)
the active infinitive is the rule, with csse and the passive as the ex-
ceptions‚ while in Cicero, the active (except in the case of malle) is
almost entirely unknown. To show the comparative usage, Iwill
give the actual number of cases in the two fields in the following
table. Outside of Gomedy and Cicero, and not shown in the table
are eight examples three of which have their predicates in the active,
four in the passive and one in esse.

Comic PoetS. Cicero.

Velle . . 21 12 7 1 2¹2 21

Cupere . Ι Ι - 1 3 5

The one example Ι have noted of velle with the active in Cicero
is Catil. 3. 25: Neque hanc urbem conflagare, sed se in hac urbe
florere voluerunt. The single case of active with nolle in Cicero is
Sull. 5: An vero in his (subselliis) me apparere nollem? For the
example with cupere cf. Sull. 32: Ut et 56 perire cuperet. The fact
is that the form of the predicate is an unessential feature of the con-
struction. It may be active, passive, or esse as the requirement of
the thought demands. What is important, however, is the meaning
of the construction as compared with that of the simple object in-
finitive.

On this point several distinct views have been held. Zumpt's2
opinion was that there is no difference in meaning between the
accusative and infinitive and the simple infinitive: “So ist es gleicls’,
he says, “ob ich sage discipulum me haberi volo, non doctorem, oder
discipulus haberi volo non doctor.'' This is also the opinion os Wex.?³
Krueger÷ holds that the accusative and infinitve emphasizes the desire
for fulfillment, “da man die Aneignung des vorliegenden Pradikates
wunsche''. The opposite of this view, however, is held by Gilders-
leeve-Lodge5 who say that “the subject may be expressed and
commonly is expressed when the action of the infinitive is not within
the power of the subject. A very subjective and somewhat curious
view is that of Haases' who in discussing Cicero's cupio me esse
