.-. 18 —
volo and its kindred expressions, but there is no [greater difficulty in
taking the pronoun as the direct object of the verb in the one case
than in the other.

Another construction in which the personal pronoun is involved
is that of the double object with velle. This particular construction
does not occur with any other verb of the class, and with a single
exception is confined to the comic poets. The exception is Caes.
B. G. Ι. 34. 2: Si quid ille se velit, illum ad se venire oportere. In
Comedy the use of this double object is restricted to certain forms
of expression and is found only in interrogative, conditional, and
relative clauses, Of the last there are only five examples: Plaut.
Bacch. 1149: Est quod 16 volo 5661610. Capt. 618: Do tibi operam,
Aristophontes, siquid est quod me velis. Rud. 1216: Sed scin quid
est quod te volo? Ter. And.45: Quid est quod me velis? Hec. 745:
Nondum etium dixi quod te volui. In conditional clauses nine cases
are found of the type of Plaut. Aul. 209: Redeo ad te, Megadore, si quid
me visk The bulk of the examples, however, occur in questions,
either direct or indirect, twenty two cases being found in this form of
sentence. Cf. Plaut. Cas. 353: Face, Chaline, certiorem 1116, quid meus vir
me velit. Cure. 343: Sed quid eum vis?'² In whatever kind of clause
the double object appears it always consists of a neuter pronoun, —
relative, indefinite, or interrogative, and a personal pronoun. XVhenever
the object desired is expressed by a noun another construction is
employed, as in Ter. Hec. 655: Si ex me illa liberos vellet sibi, and
Eun. 180: Quam ioco rem voluisti a me tandem, quin perfeceris? The
personal pronoun most frequently employed is 1116·, there is one³
case of nos, one* of vos, three5 cases of eum⁷ foui-⁶ of te, and one
of sese.

This frequent combination of the neuter pronoun and the personal
pronoun of the first person in accounted for by the fact that the
usual function of this construction of the double object is to make
some reference to the speaker's own attitude of compliance with the
wishes of another. This reference either expresses the possibility of such
compliance being desired, or it is a question as to whether it is desired.
In the latter case the question usually either takes the form of quid
me vis? or that of the formula numquid me vis?² In point of frequency
