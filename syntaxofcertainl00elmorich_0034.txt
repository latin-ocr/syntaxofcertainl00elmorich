Jupiter having taken the form of Amphytrion is within the
lattcr’s palace in company with Alcumena. Mercury in the guise of
,Xinplwtrion’s 51316 Sosia is on guard in front of the palace. To him
enters the real Sosia who comes to announce the arrival of his master
from the war. In the scene that follows Mercury maintains that 116
15 1116 1631 Sosia and the latter comes in for some rough treatment.
Every time he says that his name is Sosia and that he belongs to
Amphytrion 116 15 beaten by Mercury. Finally Sosia refuses to say
what his name is or whom he belongs to. But Mercury presses him
with the question “Didn't you say that you were Amphytrion's
Sosia?'' and he replies with the verse we have here whose general
meaning 15 quite clear: “1 made a mistake: for it was Amphytrion's
associate that Ι 11163111 10 say I am⁷'‚ the play on Sosiam and socium
being quite evident. The corruption occurs after the word socium.
The Mss. reading and 501116 of the principal corrections are 35
follows:

Nam Amphitruonis socir1m†llc‘712e 6556 volui dicere, 50 1116 editio
minor.

Nam Amphitruonis socium certe esse volui dicere, ERost, Hermann.

Nam Amphitruonis socium memet esse volui dicere, Lindermann.

Nam Amphitruonis socium memed esse volui dicere, Ritschl.

Nam Amphitruonis socium mma me esse volui dicere, Ussing.

Nam metz Amphitruonis esse socium volui dicere, Fleckeisen, 1847.

Nam illud Amphitruonis socium me esse volui dicere, Fleckeisen
and Ritschl.

Nam Amphitruonis Sosim· me esse volui dicere, Lachmann,
approved by Ritschl.

Nam Amphitruonis socium denium me esse volui dicere, Goetz.

This passage is an interesting one an account of the scholars that
have been interested in its restoration. It will be noticed that Ritschl’s
name is connected with three of the proposed corrections: the memed ¹,
the second correction of 1Τ166κ6156112 and the Sosiai3. And yet of all
these correctionS, it is hard to see how any one of them is really
possible. Memet and memed are not far from the Mss. but otherwise
they are both difficult to account for. Fleckeisen first changes the
order of the words, and in his second correction introduces illud
before Amphitruonis just as Goetz inserts dudum after socium. In
neither case does there seem to be any palaeographic reason for the
change. The certe of F. which Hermann approved, and the Sosiai
of Lachmann and Ritschl also do violence to the Mss. not only in
