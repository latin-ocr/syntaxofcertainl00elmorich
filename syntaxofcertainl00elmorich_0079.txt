The question here is, on what principle is the subjunctive vellent to
be explained? Dziatzko passes it over without comment, but lilmer
inserts the following note: “A clause dependent upon an infinitive
sometimes takes the subjunctive where the sense seems to call f‹›r the
indicative. This is probably to be accounted for by the fact that
the inlinitive is especially frequent in indirect discourse, representing
the principa} verb of the direct form. Since in indirect discourse,
subordinate clauses depending on these infinitives take the subjunctive
(see, however, note On 17) a feeling might easily arise that when any
subordinate clause depended upon an infinitive the subjunctive was
admissible.'' This note shows in what straits an editor finds himself
when he attempts to explain this subjunctive. Elmer would have us
believe in an intimate association between the subjunctive ancl relative
clauses dependent on infinitives in indirect discourse, but as a matter
of fact, in Terence, such clauses usually take the indicative. He has
himself recognized this in his note on Phor. 17, where he says: “A
relative clause in indirect discourse, unless it depends directly on
another subjunctive, commonly takes in Terence the same mode as
in direct discourse. Exeeptions are rare.⁷’ In view of this it is very
unlikely that there existed any such association as he suggests. On
the other hand, if the position Ι have taken is the right one, vellent
offers no difficulty, since it is a subjunctive only in ἴοι-ιη’, in meaning
it is indicative. It implies that the wishes had to do with the present
and that their fulfillment lay wholly in the hands of Geta.

Resides this passage there are several others where the sub-
junctive appears in a relative and where the difficulty is to be solved
in the same way. Compare Plaut. Cist. 70: Ille plus qui vocat scit
quod velit quam ego quae vocor. Cf. Epid. 426: Sine tuo labore
quod velis actumst tamen. Ter. Eun. 687: Ad nos deductus hodiest
adulescentulus quem tu videre vero velles. Other examples are Plaut.
Amph. 393 Aul. 599, 6863 As. 8443 Capt. 3633 Cist. 7063 Mil. 49, 10583
Pers. 2723 Pseud. 4833 Stich. 362.

Three other passages are worthy of note. Ter. Eun. 1080: Facile
pellas, ubi velis·‚ Capt. 343: Qui tua quae tu iusseris mandata ita ut
velis perferat. Most. 742: Vellem ut tu velles. The last of these
passages, which Ι have already quoted in another connection, is of
especial interest because it illustrates so well the point of the dis-
cussion. It is quite evident that velles is no true potential in meaning,
both in view of the reasons already given and of the fact that if it
were it could not be translated so as to make sense. “I could have
wished as you could have wished'', is certainly nonsense. What the
expression means literally is, “I wish matters were as you wish thern
to be.'' How then is the subjunctive in velles to be explained? The
answer is, on the same principle as vellem in the same sentence.
