metre is concerned the metuam of the Mss. may be retained by
reading me ames as an anapaest, the final e of me being shortened
under the ictus instead of being elided. Metuam, however, can not
stand on account of the following tamen, since if Alcumena had fears
it would he because of Amphitruo's absence and not in spite of it.

It seems to me that the first step in the restoration of this passage
is to change slightly the arrangement of the parts. I am convinced
that every thing that follows me ames should be given not to Al-
cumena, but to Jupiter. These words will then express the response
made by Jupiter to Alcumena's request. That there should be some
response is plain first from the situation. Alcumena is much distressed
over her supposed husband’s hasty departure and the latter is doing
his best to soothe her feelings. According to the Mss. arrangement,
he actually goes away without giving her any assurance on a most
vital question. Then again there are two other requests made by
Alcumena, ἡ one just before and one just after this passage —— and
to each of them Jupiter makes an appropriate answer. It seems then
altogether improbable, when she makes the most important request of
all, that he should pass it over without notice.

Assigning what follows me ames to Juppiter, for the metuam of
the Mss. I should read cupiam. Then to Alcumena’s request that he
love her when she is away, Jupiter’s response will be, “I shall be
filled with passion for you, even though you be absent.'⁷ This change
is palaeographically a difficuld one, and I offer it without being able
to explain just how the corruption arose. In point of meaning cupiam,
I think, leaves little to be desired. The word is often used of the
pleasures of love. Cf. Plaut. Amph. 132, where in the mouth of Mercury
it expresses the very passion of Amphitruo for Alcumena that we
have here: Cubat complexus, quoius cupiens maxumest. Trin. 671:
Quom inopiast, cupias. Cure. 171, where Phaedromus on being chided
by Palinurus for not embracing his mistress whom he had not seen
for some time says: sane haud quicquamst magis quod cupiam tam
diu, — “there is nothing I have so long longed to d0⁷'. — See also

Another passage which has caused much uncertainty which the
construction we have been considering, clears up is Hor. Sat. Ι. 9. 7:
Cum adsectaretur, numquid vis? occupo. At ille “noris nos⁷⁷ inquit3
docti sumus. Here there is of course no textual difficulty, but the
syntax of noris has given the commentators a great deal of trouble,
many of them insisting on taking it as a future perfect. In view,
however, of the usage of Comedy in answers to questions of this
kind, Ι think it may be regarded as settled that noris is the sub-
junctive in immediate connection with the preceding vis. If it is an
answer to Horace's question, it must be infinitive, imperative, or sub-,
