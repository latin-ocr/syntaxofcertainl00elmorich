kind from Yulg. Apoc. 9. 6¹. With optare the object infinitive is a
little more frequent. These examples are found in Comedy: Plaut. Aul. 11 2
Inopemque optavit potius eum relinquere. As. 608: Cur tu obsecro
immerito meo me morti dedere optas. Ter. Hec. 651: Hunc videre saepe
optabamus diem. Cicero has only two examples both in the Letters,
Fam. Io. 33. 1: Tantam calamitatem rei publicae quam tardissime
audire optandum est. Fam. 15. 13. 1: Maxime mihi fuit optatum
Romae esse tecum. Two examples likewise occur in Catullus 40. 6:
Qua libet esse notus optas and 76. 25: Ipse valere opto et taetrum
hunc deponere mortum2.

In placing optare in the list of verbs that admit this construction
Gildersleeve-Lodge3 remark that it is “rare except in passive''.
Whether this refers to the general occurrence of optare or to its
occurrence with this particular construction is somewhat uncertain. In
either 6356 1116 statement is unfounded. Considering the general
occurrence of the word the active is much more common than the
passive. It is not necessary to give figures for the whole field, but
out of thirty one cases in Comedy twenty four are active, while in
Cicero in the proportion is almost as great. If, however, the reference
is to optare 111111 object infinitive the statement is still more wide of
the mark, seeing that 111111 two exceptions in every example of this
usage the governing verb is in the active.

The infrequeney of this construction with desiderare and optare
is due in the case of the former to the idea of need for some missing
object which is involved in the word and which renders another verb
a somewhat unfitting object. With optare also there is no doubt that
its peculiar shade of meaning makes its unfluence strongly felt in
determining the construction that follows. Usually, as 116 have seen,
this word is employed of 111131 15 most remote from reality, and it is
easy to see that object infinitives would not be naturally used in
denoting things of this character.

Passing on to other members of the group, — velle, nolle, malle
and cupere — 116 find that this construction is so much employed
that it takes precedence over any other throughout the whole period.
This is true not only in the aggregate, but also in the case of each
individual word except that in Plautus, Terence, and Cicero the
accusative and infinitive is 501116111131 more frequent with malle. With
all these words it is interesting to observe the preference they have
for the active infinitive in the object over esse or the passive. This
