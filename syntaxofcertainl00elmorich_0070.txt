necessarily expressed in the form of the question but which may be
in the tone of the voice, and whose influence is felt in other ways, that

the strong affirmative tendency of vin tu is due.
The use of vis tu in questions, which the Horatian Commentators

have distinguished so carefully from vin tu is much less frequent than
one would suppose. In Republican literature Ι have found but
14 caseS‚ all but two in the comic poets. The passages are as
follows: Ter. And. 709: Vei-im vis dicam. And. 898: Tibi, pater, me
dedo, quidvis oneris impone, impera. Vis me uxorem ducere? hanc
amittere? Ut potero, feram. Heaut. 87: Scire hoc vis? Plaut.
Bacch. 873: Vis tibi ducentos nummos iam promittier? Men. 1156:
Vis conclamari auctionem? Mil. 787: Lautam vis, an quae nondum
sit lauta? Most. 262: Nova pictura interpolare vis opus lepidissimum?
Pers. 681: Quod te dignumst, me dignum esse vis? Rud. 107: Quid,
tu idem mihi vis fieri quod erus consuevit tibi? Rud. 1011: Vis
pugnare?¹ Afran. 132 (R.): Vis facere ut noverca vetulum derepente
deseret? Afran. 150 (R.): Facere illi satis vis quanta illius mors sit
maceries tibi? Cic. Quint. 81: Septingenta milia passuum vis esse
decursa biduo? Varro. R. R. 3. 2. 1: Dum diribentur inquit suffragia
νίς potius villae publicae utamur umbra?

It will be noticed that in some of these passages like the
first two we find simple questions without any implication of anything
else. In fact in Ter. And. 898, the context shows that special stress is
laid on the willingness of the speaker to accept either alternative.
ln most of the remaining examplcs the questions are equivalent to
dissuasions‚ warnings, or threats. For these meanings compare es-
pecially Plaut. Most. 262, Pers. 681, and Rud. 1011. Then in
Bacch. 873 we have νίς used to introduce a proposal where we should
expect vin. It must be assumed then, even though the material be
somewhat scanty, this vis tu has these three uses: it may introduce
a pure question, it may serve to dissuade the person addressed from
some comtemplated action, or it may, in very rare cases, if the present
texts be accepted, have the same function as vin.

If now we apply our conclusions in respect to vin tu and vis tu
to the two examples in Horace-¹, we shall be much inclined question
the reading in both cases, to believe in fact that the two readings
ought to be interchanged. If usage be the test, vin tu can not stand
in the vin tu curtis Iudaeis oppedere? of Sat. 1. 9. 7o since there is
not a single instance of its introducing a question having the import
of this one. Vis tu, however, could stand here amply supported by

 

¹ On this passage Sonnenschein has the note: Vis = visne = vin 1035, implying
apparently that vis and vin have the same force. But surely the implication of one
question is not the same as the other.
