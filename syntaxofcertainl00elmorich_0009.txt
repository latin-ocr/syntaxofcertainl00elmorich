CHAPTER l.

Desire in the title of this paper is used in accordance with a
classification of Delbriick¹ to include both wish and will. Understood
in this wide sense, the category of verbs of desire is a somewhat
extensive one, the whole of which it seems impracticable to treat
within the compass of these pages. I have accordingly selected for
study a special group made up of velle, nolle, malle, cupere, deside-
rare, and optare. These words of kindred meaning appear to me of
unusual interest not only on account of the important part they play
in the language and of the unsettled questions connected with their
use, but also because of the fact that no systematic treatment of them
has as yet appeared2. In my own study of them Ι have not
attempted to go beyond the literature of the Republic³; within the
limits of this period, it has been my aim to examine all the passages
where any of the words in question occur, and to base my statements
on a practically complete collection of material.

In working over this material, Ι have had in mind mainly questions
of syntax, and what follows will deal chiefly with syntactical relations.
Howcver, before taking up this part of the subject, I wish, without
attempting at all to trace the semasiological development of the words
in question, to discuss briefiy some questions of meaning which in-
evitably arise in a study of this kind.

One of these questions comes up in the case of velle, which on
account of the frequency of its occurrence, the variety of its con-
structions and the wide range of its meaning, is the most important
word of our list. Velle is primarily a verb of volition, and the question
has arisen whether in addition to expressing this idea it can also
denote a pure wish as distinguished from an act of the will properly
so called. It is often held÷ that this extension of meaning does not
take place and that velle is exclusively a verb of will.
