vocem? CLE. Sine eam: te nolo, si occupatast¹. Tcr. Hcc. 725:
PH. Sed vin adesse 1116 una, dum 1513111 convenis, LA. Immo
hinc abi.

The non-committal character of vin tu is also illustrated in one
passage by its usc in a double question. Plaut. Merc. 150: Vin
tu te mihi obsequentem esse an nevis? Thc question here is an ex-
cited one, but the form of the whole implies that it is a matter of
free choice as to which alternative is chosen, although the speaker
may in reality prefer 1116 former.

The strong affirmative tendency which characterizes so many of
these questions, is shown by 1116 fact that in the majority of cases
their purpose is to pave the way for some action on the speaker’s
part as soon as the assent of the other person concerned shall have
been attained. In these cases, their force is rather 11131 of a proposal
which looks forward to some further action, rather than that of an
exhortation, although the one easily passes into the other. An ex-
cellent illustration of this usage is Plaut. Trin. 59 where Callicles
proposes to Megaronides that they exchange wives: Vin commutemus?
tuam ego ducam et tu meam? Likewise in Μ61·6.485 Eutychus
offers his servises to Charinus with the question: Vin patri sublinere
pulchre me os tuo? This same use of the question for the purpose
of making some proposal is seen in passages like the following:
Plaut. Pers, 659: Vin vendere istanc? Pers. 587: TOX. Vin 136116 emere?
DOR. Vin tu pulchre vendere? Mil. 978: ΡΑ. 11111110 vin tu lepide
facere? ΡΥ. Loquere et consilium cedo. Capt. 858: Vin te faciam
fortunatum. Poen. 990: Vin appellem hunc Punice? Rud. 1035: Vin
qui in hac villa habitat eius arbitratu fieri? Rud. 1328: LA. Vin
centum et mille? GR. Dormis.

Sometimes these proposals take on 3 warmer tone 35 111 Plaut.
Most. 322: Visne ego te 36 tu me amplectare. Compare also Truc. 924:
Vin te amplector, suavium dem. Of an altogether different tone, but
at the same expressing strong feeling is Ter. Ad. 906: Eho, vin tu huic
seni auscultare? and with it may be compared Heaut. 585. Other
examples will 136 found in the passages quoted in the preceding
paragraph.

It seems to me, then, that the use of vin tu may be summed up
as follows: Its primary function is to express a proposal, which when
accompanied by strong feeling, becomes practically an exhortation.
This 1310130531 may be accepted or rejected, although as a matter of
fact acceptance is much more frequent than rejection. In any case
the speaker desires acceptance, and it is to this feeling which is not

by his rejoiner. Cf. the non places of Merc. 462.
