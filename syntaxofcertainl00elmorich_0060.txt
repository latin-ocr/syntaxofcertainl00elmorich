accusative and infinitive when any one of the three following conditions
are present: (a) when the predicate is passive3 (b) when the governing
verb is not in the first pers0n3 (c) when the subject of the dependent
verb 15 3 thing. The subjunctive, on the other hand, occurs only Α
when all of the three conditions which follow, exist together in the
same sentence: (a) when the predicate is active3 (b) when the
governing verb is in the first pers0n3 (c) when the subject of the
dependent verb is not a thing. This is an interesting classification,
but it is still a mechanical one. Moreover, it will be easy to show
that it confines the subjunctive construction within much too narrow
boundaries. In the first place, the subjunctive is sometimes found
when the predicate is passive. Cf. Plaut. Poen. 1151: Patruo advenienti
cena curetur volo. Ter. And. 30: Nempe ut curantur recte haec?
(where vis is to be supplied). Cic. Fam. ΙΙ. 18. 3: Quare velim
equidem ut plane abiectus et fractus sit Antonius. Dom. 47: Velitis
iubeatisne ut M. Tullio aqua et igni interdicatur ¹. These cases are, it is
true⁷ the reverse of numerous: it is not because this particulir con-
struction is inadmissible, but the scarcity is due to the fact that for
some reason, the passive subjunctive, independent or paratactic is rare
in Latin, bearing to the active the ratio of 29 to 1600 or less than
2 per cent2. Then again when the subjunctive occurs the governing
verb is not always in the third person. In Plautus and Terence there
are 42 instances and in Cato 2 os the second person. This usage is
also not unknown to Cicero; the 4 examples of velitis with the sub-
junctive in the orations have already been mentioned. Another
interesting example in Fam. 2. IO. 2: Velles enim, ais, tantum modo
ut haberem negotii quod esset ad laureolam satis. Compare also
Phil. 2. 44: Visne igitur te inspiciamus a puero?

Here again the construction is admissible whenever the appropriate
idea is to be expressed. But 1116 greatest mistake which Fisher makes
is the restriction of the subjunctive construction to cases where the
subject of the dependent verb is not a thing. In the table at the
beginning of the chapter is shown the number of neuter subjects os
the dependent subjunctives in Comedy and in Cicero. The number is
not so large as that of the personal subjects‚ but it is large enough
to show that absolutely no distinction can be made on this basis, that
in the subjunctive construction both personal and thing subjects 316
freely used wherever the thought requires.

Fisher's classification also has the effect of depriving the accu-
sative and infinitive construction of a large number of cases that
belong to it. It does this by ruling out of the construction the first
