qualemque eum maxime velle esse et optare debemus. N. D. 3. 95:
lio-0 vero et opto redargui me. Cornif. 4. 47: Is optet istum maximas
poenas dedisse.

With respect to the remaining words of the group, however, this
construction is of great importance¹ not only on account of its
frequency‚ but also because of certain points of difficulty that arise in
connection with it.

It can be seen by referring to the tables on page just how large
a part the accusative and the infinitive play in the usage of velle,
nolle, malle, and cupere. After the simple object infinitive, it is the
most used of any method of expression possible with these verbs2.
It is of course the common method when the subject of the infinitive
is different from that of the governing verb, although its use is by no
means confined to this case, nor under such conditions is the accu-
sative and infinitive always employed.

The question arises whether there exists any definite relation
between the character of the subject accusative and that of the
predicate, —— whether, for instance, there is a tendency to connect
personal subjects with active predicates and subjects denoting things
with passive predicates or with esse. With this question in mind, Ι
have separated the subject accusatives and the predicates found in
Comedy and in Cicero into the categories just mentioned. The
results are not very satisfactory except as showing with what
freedom the construction may be used. In Comedy and in all os
Cicero except the philosophical works, the personal subject is more
common than that denoting a thing, a usage which finds its ex-
planation in the character of the writing from which the examples are
taken. As to the predicate, the passive is found in the greater
number of examples with velle while with nolle, malle and cupere
the reverse is true. If in the case of the latter words, the
predicates in esse be added to the passives, the aggregate is greater
than the predicates in the active. In regard to the supposition that
personal subjects would tend to connect themselves rather with active
predicates, we find that it holds good only in Comedy and in Cicero's
Letters. Ι11 1116 former, we have 215 personal subjects‚ 137 active

 

¹ Deecke, Lat. Infinitiv- Gerundial- und Supinum-Konstruktion. p.38. uses expressions
like volo vos abire and cupio me esse clementem as evidence that the infinitive was
originally a locative.

'-' Gildersleeve-Lodge‚ Latin Grammar, 532, n. 3, make the extraordinary statement
that “with the Potentia] forms velim, malim, vellem, mallem, Cicero uses only the Subj.¹’
This, curiously enough, 15 also the view that De Monte took in his Latium Restitutnm.
See vol. HI, p. 1314. In the Letters alone there are 22 instances of velim with the
accusative and infinitive and 10 of vellem. Malim and mallem also are found in the
same construction though with not so great frequency, to say nothing of nolim and
nollem. XVhen the constructions which occur with these forms are considered, it will
be seen how wide of the mark the statement is.
