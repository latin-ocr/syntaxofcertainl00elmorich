and equivalent in meaning to “I wish, Ι trust, or Ι hope”. That this
is true is further evidenced by the fact that in a passage precisely
similar to those quoted above velim is replaced by spero, The
passage is Pers. 618, in a scene that immediately precedes the one
last mentioned. Toxilus speaks to the maiden who is to be sold
and says: non diu apud hunc servies, to which she replies: ita pol
spero. Here velim might easily be substituted for spero3 it would be
in fact the more common idiom.

If the potential meaning of velim is inadmissible in expressing
one's satisfaction at receiving what one desireS, it would seem to be
equally so in asking for objects of this kind in prayers and earnest
wishes. Of velim in prayers Ι will quote three or four examples¹,
all in Cicero. Cf. Fam. 2. 18. 3: Tu quod egeriS, id velim di ad-
probent3 Verr. 5. 37: Ita mihi deos propitios velim and the same
formula in div. Caec. 413 Phil. Ι. 13: Hoc ignoscant di immortales
velim et populo Romano. Here the very fact that these are prayers
to heaven seems to me to exclude the potential idea. Otherwise it
is necessary to believe that men pray contingentiy‚ that Cicero does
not really wish for the things mentioned in these passageS, but that
he is capable of wishing for them at some future time and under
circumstances of a certain kind. The same principle holds good in
earnest wishes, three examples of which will be sufficient. Cf. Ter.
Eun. 786: Fundam tibi nunc nimis vellem dari. Ad. 680: Ita velim
me promerentem ames ut id mihi vehementer dolet. Cic. Fam. 5. 21.1:
Omnia quae opto contingant ut vementer velim. Here again the very
earnestness of the wish is an indication of its reality.

From prayers and earnest wishes it is but a short step to threats and
curses. These, however, are of interest here, not primarily on account
of their character as such, but because of the fact that they often
contain velim with the perfect passive infinitive or with the perfect
subjunctive. In these conbinations Ι find one of the strongest pieces
of evidence for the indicative force of velim. Ι will first give some
examples of each construction, beginning with the infinitve. Plaut. Bacch.
603: PAR. Sufflatus ille huc veniet. ΡΙ. Dirruptum velim. Cas, 326:
Ego edepol illam mediam diruptam velim. Curc. 83: Nolo, hercle.
Nam istunc qui fert, afflictum velim: ego nobis ferri censui. Stich. 191:
Ei hercle ego verbo lumbos diffractos velim. Stich. 613: Edepol te
hodie lapide percussum velim. For the perfect subjunctive compare
Poen. 570: Quin etiam deciderint vobis femina in talos velim. Rud.
652: Nimis velim improbissumo homini malas edentaverint. Ter.
Ad. 519: Quod cum salute eius fiat, ita se defatigarit velim. The two
