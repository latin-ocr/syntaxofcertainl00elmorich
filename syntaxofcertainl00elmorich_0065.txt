Ι11 establishing this text, is necessary to show first how the
corruption arose. At first thought it seems easier to regni-d sitas
having changed into the old form siet which we find inJ and to
believe that the fiet in Β D is a corruption 01 11115. But this is un-
likely 101 11νο 16350115. In the first place copyists are much more
likely to change archaic forms into those that are not than to do the
reverse. In this case it is altogether improbable that sit would be
changed into siet without improving the sense and at the same time
spoiling the metre. Then againJ is an inferior Ms. and there is
reason to believe that its siet is not the old form, but merely a
corruption of the fiet 01 Β D. 11 11115 be true, we have to assume
that an original sit passed into fiet, and this is in fact a very easy
change. First sit became fit by the confusion of the very similar 5
and f¹3 but, as the tense did not suit the context, some copyist
changed the present to the future to help out the sense and without
regard to the metre.

In support of the subjunctive without ut in the answer Iwill
quote three parallels2.

Plaut. Cure. 524: LY. Numquid vis, leno? CA. Istas minas
decem, dum melius sit mihi, des. Bacch. 604: ΡΑ. Numquid vis?
ΡΙ. Abeas. Aul. 216: Quid nunc me vis? MEG. Quae res recte
vortat mihique tibique tuaeque filiae³.

A second textual difficulty which occurs in the same verse with
a construction of this kind but which is not 115611 actually concerned
with it, is Plaut. Amph. 542.

IUP. Numquid vis? ALC. Ut quom absim, 1116 311165, me'tuam
(me tuam D) te absentem. BEJ. Me tuam absentem, Camerarius,

This passage occurs in the scene where Jupiter in the guise of
Amphitruo is taking leave 01 Alcumena. According to the Mss.
Jupiter asks “have you any commands 101 me?” and Alcumena
replies “yes, Ι want you to love me when Ι am away from you·‚ Ι
shall have my 16315 about you even though you be absent'’. Or
accepting the me tuam 01 Camerarius for the me tuam te 01 D.
Alcumena's reply is, “I want you to love me when Ι 3111 away from
you, —— me who am yours even though I be absent”. So far as the

3 By using 3 knowledge of this construction Brandt could have improved his
emendation in 3 very marked degree. Instead of dividing the words between the two
speakers, he might have given them all to Euclio and read. EUC. Stuc fiat. Vale.
still there is a doubt as to wheter stuc is a real form in Latin. Corssen (Aussprache ΙΙ,
629) and Lachmann (on Lucret. p,r97) have attempted to show its existence. but Luchs
(Student. stud. 1. 47), and Dziatzko (Phor. Einleitung‚ p. 62) think the form has not
sufficient evidence.
