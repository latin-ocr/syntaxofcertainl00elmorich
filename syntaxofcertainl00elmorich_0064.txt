I have written together the readings that divide the words between
the two speakers and also those that give the whole answer to Euclio.
In running over the list, it is easy to see that some of the corrections
are to be rejected on purely palaeographic grounds. I take it to be
a principle which no one disputes (though many seem to forget it)
that an emendation should account for the corruption. Now let us apply
this test to the changes of Langen, Goetz, and Abraham. Leaving
out of question the assigning of the words to two speakers instead of
to one, since the Mss. are untrustworthy in the assignment of parts,
one might ask how Langen would derive the fiet or siet of the Mss.
from the interjection ei of his own reading. Or more difficult still,
how could Abraham get istuc fiet out of ut valeas, or by what
process of error could Goetz bring festina et to the same cor-
ruption? It seems to me that these changes are palaeographically
impossible. Of the remaining correction⁷ one may admit that they
do little violence to the Mss. but they all violate another fundamental
principle that an emendation must at least be in accordance with the
usage of the language. What this usage is in answer to questions
of this kind we have already seen, and no answer having
anything like the form proposed in these readings has been found.
Expressing the answer by a pronoun‚ or by a pronoun and a
verb understood, if that were possible, is entirely unknown and
apparently wholly foreign to the idiom of the language. It seems to
me then, without saying anything of the harshness of these readings
or how out os character it is for the polite Megadorus to break in on
Euclio's reply‚ that we may safely reject the corrections in question
purely on the basis of the elementary principle that they are really
not Latin.

The reading Ι have to propose is:

MEG. I'bo igitur parabo. Numquid me vis? EUC. Istuc sit: vale.

This reading gives all the answer to Euclio as it is in the Mss.‚ involves

but a slight change in the original words, and gives just the sense that
is required.
