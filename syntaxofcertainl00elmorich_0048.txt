and Kuehner ¹. According to others the purpose of the construction
in the passive is to indicate the state of mind of the speaker with
reference to the fulfillment of his desire. Zumpt2 seems to have this
in mind when he says: “ssei diesem XVorte steht dann auch der In-
finitiv Perfecti Pass. urspriinglich, um den Eifer und die Schnelligkest,
mit der etwas geschehen, auszudriicken.'’ Likewise, according to
Draeger²³ the perfect infinitive in this connection expresses “die Un-
geduld, mit welcher eine bei-eits eingetretene Erfullung des VVunsches
oder XYillens erwartet wi1·d.'' The same opinion is held by Gilder-
sleeve4-Lodge‚ who say that “in the Passive the Perfect Infinitive is
used after verbs of Will and Desire to denote impatience of anything
except entire fulfillment''. This view of Draeger and of Gildersleeve-
Lodge seems to have no other foundation than the fact that when
one wishes for the completior] of some action rather than for the
performance of the action itself, he is likely to be impatient for the
result. But this need not always be the case3 moreover, when we
look to the rest of the sentence for some indications of this impatience
on part of the speaker, they are nowhere to be found. On the other hand
compare Plaut. Capt. 309: Hegio, hoc te monitum nisi forte ipse non vis,
voluerarm here the attitude of the speaker is one of deference as his
own nisi forte ipse non vis and the loquere audacter in Hegio's reply
show, and the impatience of anything except entire fulfillment is
conspicuously absent. As a rule there is no clue in the
sentences in which examples occur, which gives any indication of
the speaker's state of mind with reference to the attainment of his
desire.

The future perfect force of velle and the like when ‘joined with
a perfect infinitive is shown by the fact that the action is often
represented as completed before another action. The number of ex-
amples of this kind, are fewer than one should expect. Cf. Plaut.
