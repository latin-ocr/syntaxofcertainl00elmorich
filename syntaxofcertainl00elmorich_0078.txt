their indicative meaning. Then by analogy this meaning spread to
the other forms of the same tenses and to the corresponding forms
of nolle and malle. In this way these forms came to be simply verbs
of wishing, employed in the different constructions and having no
potential meaning. Traces of the paratactic connection is also found
in the fact that in other constructions velim is used of wishes whose
fulfillment lies in the future and vellem of those to be realized in the
present. The same is true of the same forms of nolle and malle.

If this view is the true one, it is not the first instance where a
potential has acquired the [0166 0[ 311 indicative under special
influence. An example of this is the potential optative with ἄν 111 Greek,
which in negatives often has the [0166 0[ 311 absolute refusal, as in
Ar. Nub. 119 where Phidippides says to his father ὀνκ ἄν πιθοίμηνῖ.
Α still better example in Ar. Achar. 405 where the optative is
paralled by a future indicative: ὅυ γάρ ἄν ἀπέλθοιμι, ἀλλὰ κόψω τὴν
{Ji-(mast.

Even in affirmative sentences the indicative meaning is found.
Cf. Ar. Eq. 40: λέγοιμι ἄν ἤδη and the same play 1110: τρέχοιμι ἄν
εἴσω πρότεροςὲ. What the cause of this change in meaning is, Ι need
not here inquire3 it is sufficient to note that the change has actually
taken place 1⁴.

In Latin there is a parallel in the subjunctive of characteristic.
This was originally potential, but has come to express not so much
what would be as what actually is. Again if we accept a “can'’
potential we have a change of the same kind. Bennett, in speaking
of such expressions as videas corde amare inter se says⁴z “In their
origin, they were undoubtedly subjunctive of contingent futurity, but
I think it must be clear to all that they have so [31 grown away
from their first [0166 as now to convey an entirely different notion'⁷.
If changes like these can take place both in Latin and Greek there
ought to be nothing incredible in the one 1 have described.

One result of believing in the indicative meaning of these forms
is that it removes the difficulty of accounting for the subjunctive as such
in certain subordinate clauses. A good illustration of this is Ter. Phor. 79
where Geta in speaking of his management of the two young men
left to his care says: coepi eis omnia facere, obsequi quae vellent.

³3 Latin shows at least one parallel to this usage in Plaut. Aul. 570: MEG, Potare
ego hodie, Euclio tecum volo. EUC. Non potem ego quidem hercle. MEG. At ego
iussero cadum unum vini veteris a me adferrier. EL'C. Nolo hercle. Here the poten-
tial non potem is equivalent to a negative future. This is shown by the context, and
by the repetition of non potem by nolo in the second refusal.
