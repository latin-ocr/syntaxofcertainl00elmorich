It is to be observed that in giving this explanation ot vin tu,
the editors quote no parallel passage from either Plautus or Terence,
the fact being that no such passages are to be found. In these
authors, and the idiom is met with hardly any where else in
Republican literana-eg the form vin or vin tu occurs 49 times and
visne 3 times, and in no case is the purpose of the question
towarn the person addressed or to dissuade him from a certain
action or course of action. On the other hand the question in
form usually is ostensibly neutral⁷ leaving the one spoken to free
to answer yes or no. In the majority of cases, however, the context
itself shows that the speaker desires an affirmative answer‚ and in
some cases this feeling is so strong that the question amounts
almost to an exhortation. It may be said then that vin tu while non-
committal in form, tends strongly to the affirmative pole, and not

to the negative one, as Kirkland and other commentators on Horace
have held.

This non-committa] character is made clear by observing the
answers which are actually given to the question and by noting that
they are sometimes affirmative ancl sometimes negative. The former
kind are more than three times as frequent as the latter, the
figures being 25 affirmative to 7 negative. Some of the passages
showing affirmative answers are as follows: Plaut. Amph. 769: AL.
Vin proferre pateram? AM. Proferri volo. Poen. 159: MIL. Vin tu
illi nequam dare nunc? AG. Cupio. Poen. 163: MIL. Vin tu illam
hodie tuam libertam facere? AG. Cupio. Pers, 656: DO. Vin mea
esse? Vi. Dum quidem ne nimis diu tua sim, volo. Rud. 1406: Vin
tibi condicionem luculentam ferre me? LA. Sane volo. Ter. Phor.

1053: PH. Vin primum hodie facere quod ego gaudeam? NA. Cupio.
Ad. 969: ML Vin tu hoc fieri? ΑΕ. Cupio ³.

In the following we find a negative answer expressed: Plaut.
Merc. 462: CHA. Vin me tecum illo ire? DE. Nolo. Merc. 769:
CO. Vein me experirei. LY. Nolo. Poen. 1415: ΞΥ. Vin tibicinam
meam habere? ANT. Nihil moror tibicinam. Cas. 544: AL. Vin.

ἶ There are several cases in Cicero: ()r.173; Part. Or.2; Phil. 2. 443 Fam.
4. 5. 4; Rep. 1. 15; Legg 1.15.

2 Mortis, Senttnce Question in Plaut. and Ter. Am.Jour. Phil. XI, 21, holds that
in general ne z nonne questions have only a slight negative shading. Glocknei· in his
article on Nc and Num, Archiv f. Lat, Pal. xl. 491, goes much further in the
affirmative direction.

3 Cf. also Plaut. As. 646, 6473 Merc.49o; Stich.486, 736; Mil. 335, 535, 979; Merc.
485, 721; True. 502, 9243 Pers. 6593 Poen. 161, 308, 1226; Ter. Eun. 8953 Hec. 787:
l'hor. 810, 811. With these passages cf. Heaut. 624, where Chremes puts into a
question a request that has just been made by his wife: Vin me istuc tibi, (at incredi-
bile est) credere? Credo.
