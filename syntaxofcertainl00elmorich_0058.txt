speaker's Sprachgcfiihl does not otherwise manifest itself in the sentence,
and its existence is after all only a, matter of surmise.

Leaving the presence or absence of ut out of consideration a few
more words are necessary on the meaning of the subjunctive con-
struction. Ι wish also to refer to its first appearance in the literature
in connection with volo and velim. Here again Ι am compelled to
call in question the statements ofGildersleeve-Lodge¹. Under the
head of‘⁴Pe1·iphrases” certain expressions are mentioned as “common
circumlocutions for the Positive Impe1·ative”·, then in a note the
remark is added that “Terence introduces volo, velim with the Suij.
which is found also in later times; as C. Fam. IX, 12. 2.’⁷ One must
first of all express surprise at the statement that volo, velim with the
subjunctive were introduced by Terence. Is it possible that Plautus
shows no examples of these forms with this construction? Certainly
such is not the case. How extensive this usage is can be seen
from the table at the beginning of this chapter. Velim with the sub-
junctive is not so common in Plautus as volo, but the number of ex·
amples is more than sufficient for the purpose. With such abundant
justificatior] of the usage in Plautus it is remarkable that it should have
been altogether overlooked by Gildersleeve-Lodge‚ though perhaps not
less so than the inclusion os hundreds of cases os the same construction
in Cicero under the statement that it “is found also in later times’'. Ι
must also take exception to the classification of velim with the sub-
junctive as a circumlocution for the Positive Imperative. Keeping in
mind the broad range of the imperative Ι still believe that the ex-
pression is one of wishing rather than willing. Ι am led to this
conclusion principally by the force of velim itself, by the character
ot' the modifying words that are occasionally found with it, and by
the fact that the following subjunctive is often found in the third person
with a neuter subject. Thus: Cic. Att. 5. 21. 3: Velim ita sit·,
14. 11. 2: Velim sint prospera3 Fam. 2. 12. 1: Obviae mihi velim sint
tuae litterae3 3. 3. 1: Velim tibi curae sit3 Ep. ad Brut. Ι. ΙΟ. 5: Velim
deinceps meliora sint. In expressions like these the speaker is
evidently not seeking to impose his own will, but is wishing or hoping
for a certain state of things in the future, over which he has no
control. It is natural to assume, when the subject of the subjunctive
is a person, that the same point of view is maintained. This will
appear more clearly in the following chapter in which the force of
velim is to be discussed.

Another important relation is that of the subjunctive construction
to the accusative and infinitive. We find the two usages constantly
over-lapping. Thus, by way of illustration, we have in Cic. Fam.
