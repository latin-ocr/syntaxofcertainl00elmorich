<Spera et propter te improbior. BA. 'Veneris quam mea mavellem.
This reading, in the first place, may be said, I think, to account for
the ne is of the Mss. Assuming Veneris to have been the original
reading the corruption could have arisen in either of two ways: thc
middle of the word may have fallen out as in Mil. (569 where the
Mss. have optis for optassis; or thc first syllable and the following r
may have been lost, a change which is ilustrated in Mil. 1332 where
the Mss. have certo for ecferto. Moreover the verse 15 sound met-
rically, the correction giving an anapaest in the fifth foot, which is
appropriate after the fourth foot with the diaeresis. To be noted also
is the falling of the ictus on the last syllable. In proper names of this
type the ictus in Comedy most commonly falls on the first syllable,
but next in point of frequency to receive it is the third syllable, 35
we have here. Then it seems to me that in point of meaning,
Veneris gives the best sense 01 any correction that has been pro-
posed. The quam mea mavellem 01 1116 Μ55. shows that some sharp
constrast to the preceeding statement is to be expressed. Nicobulus
has said to the courtesan, “It is through your influence that I am so
bad⁷'·, now if she replies “you had better say it is through your own
influence⁷⁷ or “through the influence of your son”, the antithesis,
especially in the latter case, is not very pointed. If however, the
courtesan says. “Why don't you say it is the influence 01 your own
passion rather than my influence?”‚ we feel not only that the anti-
thesis is more striking, but that the sentiment itself is· thoroughly in
keeping with the character of the speaker. Venus as the goddess of
sensual love is so often referred to that it would be tedious to quote
all the passages.. References to her in this character are perhaps more
frequent in the Poenulus than any other play of Plautus. See the
following verses: 261, 276, 407, 450, and also Varro Sat. 154: Ego
autem qui essem plenus vini et veneris. Other parallels are Lucret.
4110? and 41113.
