that velim as a potential is not suitable for 11116315 and curses, saying
that we have the same thing in the English “I would like to see him
lose all his money'', “I'd like to see him thrashed'⁷, which in Latin
are “velim omnes fortunas amittat’', and “velim verberer& In the
first place, “like'' in the sense 01 “receive pleasure from” is not an
accurate translation of the Latin velle. Moreover, “I should like'
does not express a wish at all except by inference. It expresses the
opinion with more or less certainty that something would in a given
case give the speaker pleasure, and it is easily infer-red that what is
likely to give him pleasure is also his wish. It is this complete
shutting out 01 311 113665 01 the speaker⁷s will in the form 01 1116 ex-
pression that leads no doubt to its frequent use. It is also to be
noted that the implied wish in “I should lil<e'’ is not itself a con-
tingent 0116. The receiving 01 1116 pleasure may be contingent, but
1116 wish inferred from it 15 3 1631 0116, existing at the time the
speaker utters the words. Finally, though this need not be insisted
on, “I should like⁷’ is itself 1101 always contingent in meaning, being
often equivalent 1101 10 something “would’'‚ but to something “will
give me pleasure'⁷. The result is that there is no objection to
translating velim by “I should lil<e⁷'·, in fact as implying 311 11116011-
ditional wish it is a very accurate translation. But it should be kept
111 mind that this translation is no evidence that velim 1135 3 potentia]
meaning, if it is evidence at all, it points the other way.

Ι 601116 now 10 1116 reasons for believing that the present and
imperfect subjunctive forms 01 velle have 111 meaning practically the
force 01 indicatives. The first 01 111656 16350115 15 1116 1361 thatin
several passages this subjunctive is used parallel to an indicative.
Compare Plaut. Amph. 1057: Vae miserae mihi. Animo malest,
aquam velim. Ter. Eun. 333: Nisi nunc quom minime vellem,
minumeque opus 11111. Eun. 958: Quod ego numquam vidi fieri neque
velim. Cic. Att. 6. 6. 1: Id quidem, inquis, di adprobent. Ita velim,
teque ita cupere certe scio. Fam. 11. 18. 3: Qua re velim, id quod
spero, ut plane abiectus et fractus sit Antonius. The first, second, and
last 01 these examples seem to me especially conclusive. In the one
from Cicero the state of mind denoted by velim is expressly described
as a hope which existed at the time in the speaker's mind. The
wish therefore cannot be a contingent one. If it were, the sub-
junctive form of spero would undoubtedly have been employed. As
it is, Cicero seems to feel no difference of modal meaning in the
two words¹.
