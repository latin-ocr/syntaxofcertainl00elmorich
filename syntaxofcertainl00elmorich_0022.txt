that that of the substantive object is a prominent one. In the case
of desiderare, except for scattering cases, no other construction would
occur. In Comedy it is also the most frequent construction for velle,
though this is far from being the case in Cicero and the remaining
authors of the period. Still, the usage is an important one for every
word of the group, especially in the comic poets and in Cicero.

In this construction the object is denoted by a noun or pronoun,
but it is interesting to observe, except in the case of desiderare, the
great preponderance of the pronoun. This is especially true of velle.
One can not say that noun objects of these words are absolutely
infrequent, but they form by the side of the pronouns a comparatively
small class.

In seeking to account for the preponderance of pronoun over
noun objects with all words of our group except desiderare, it is
necessary to take into consideration the comparatively small number
of abstract terms in Republican Latin. Thus it is that when a writer
wishes to speak of his own purpose, desire, or preference as such, or
of that of another, he usually employs not an abstract term, but a
relative clause with the relative in the accusative. In the same way,
when he inquires concerning the purpose or desire of another, he
does not use the interrogative with sententia or voluntas, but the more
concrete form of interrogative and verb. Thus also in expressions
concerning the extent of the purpose or desire we find the pronoun
and the verb. Such phrases as id quod volt, quod volumus, quod
voluerunt, ea quae cupis, id quod malim, quid voltis? Si quid volunt,
will illustrate my meaning. They all involve pronoun objects and
they are used, instead of abstract terms, for the expression of ever
recurring ideas. A noun, on the other hand, can not with any verb

of this class enter into a phrase that takes the place of a general
term.

Another reason for the infrequency of noun objects is to be found
in the meanings of certain of the verbs themselves. This is especially
true of velle and nolle which in the great majority of cases contain
the idea of purpose. Now purpose as a rule contemplates, not so
much things as actions, so that a noun (other than a complementary
infinitive) is not generally a suitable object for either of these verbs.
This same influence makes itself felt, though not perhaps so strongly
in malle and cupere, and the reason is the same, —— that the
ideas which these words express find their realization in action, rather
in things. Desiderare on the other hand, which contains the accessory
notion of need naturally takes a noun for its object, and it is not
surprising to find that in Cicero, with whom it is a favorite word,
this construction is more frequent than all the rest.
