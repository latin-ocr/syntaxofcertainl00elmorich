person of the governing verb, and yet hardly any usage is morc
common. For example, compare velle with the accusative and infinitive in
Cicero’s Letters. There are 53 examples of volo, 22 of velim, and Io
of vcllcm. The same idiom with nolo and malo is common in Plautus
and Terence and in the other works of Cicero.

Not only is Fisher's classification thus defective in details, but the
general principle which confines the subjunctive construction to cases
where there is a change of subject can not be insisted on. XVhen
the subject remains remains the same, the rule is that we have the
direct infinitive, — a rule which Fisher himself puts down in categorical
fashion. We have already seen what an important exception to this
principle is made by the large number of examples which show the
accusative and infinitive under the same conditions. But this is not
the only exception, since, we find also the subjunctive. The examples
Ihave noted are the following, though in some of them the sub-
junctive, being in the plural is more inclusive than the other; still,
the person remains the same. Cf. Plaut. Bacch. 708: Ah, placide volo
unumquidque agamus Cas. 923: Volo ut obvortam. Stich. 670:
Volo eluamus hodie. Cic. Att. 7. Ι. 2; Ac vellem a principio te
audissem amicissime monentem. Att. Io. 17. 3: Ocellam vellem
haberemus Fam. 12. 12. 5: Ae velim, ut meremur de re publica, sit
felices simus. See also Plaut.Aul.661·‚ Most. 3223 Truc. 742 ¹. In view
of these examples it seems hardly worth while to put much emphasis
on the change of subject. As a principle it neither separates the
subjunctive construction from the accusative and infinitive, nor draws
the line between these two usages on the one hand and the object
infinitive on the other. And there is no reason to believe that it
would do so·, it would be strange indeed, if the processes of language
were determined in so artificial a way.

It is clear, then, that the subjunctive may be used when the
subject changes or when it remains the same3 when the governing
verb is in the first, second or third person, and when the subject Of
the subjunctive is either a person or a thing. The true limitations os
this construction are determined, as we have already seen, by original
parataxis together with its analogical force, and by the influence of
ut with optare. We expect, in other words, any subjunctive with
velle, nolle, malle, which may have been originally a paratactic one,
which arises from the analogy of such, or which is due to the sub-
junctive with optare. Within these limits the usage may be freely
employed. One result of this is, that, so far as the person of the
governing verb and the change ot* subjects are concerned, the sub-
junctive construction overlaps that of the accusative and infinitive3 in

¹ For the same usage with optare see Cic. Fam. 8. 1. 43 12. 10. 3.
