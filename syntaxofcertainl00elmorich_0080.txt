Both are subjunctive only in form and are used with the same freedom
as indicatives to which they are in reality equivalent.

Iwill close my paper by proposing an emendation of Plaut.
Baech. 1201, which contains an imperfect subjunctive similar in
character to those I have dealt with in this chapter.

The passage is within a few verses of the end of the play
and the scene is in front of the house of the Bacchides The
old men who have corne to demand their sons who are inside have
not only been coaxed to forgive them by the courtesans, but have
themselves been wheedled into consenting to go within to share in
the drinking3 whereupon Nicobulus remarks: Tua sum opera et propter
te improbior, to which one of the sisters replies Ne is quam mea
mavellem. The difficulty is in the ne is which neither makes sense
nor satisfies the metre. The history Of the verse is shown in the
following Mss. variations and proposed emendations:

NI. Tua sum opera et propter te improbior. BA. Ne is quam
mea mavellem. B.

BA. Ne is quam meam vellem. C. D. F.
BA. Nusquam me avelles. Z.
BA. Nusquam tu a me avelles. Cam.
BA. Netis quam mea mavellem. Schneider.
BA. Ne tua quam mea mavellem. Spengel.
BA. Eius quam mea mavellem. Ussing.

It seems that Bentley also emended this line by inserting me after
mavellem. This reading was written by Bentley on the margin of
his copy of Camerarius’ edition of Plautus and is reported among
others by Sonnenschein in an appendix to his edition of the Captives
and by Schoeder'. We are not told, however, how Bentley read the
rest of the line, and without this knowledge it is impossible to judge
of the value of the emendation. Of the remaining conjectures that of
Camerarius may be dismissed as doing violence to Mss. and as not
giving the sense the context requires. The reading proposed by
Schneider and accepted by Goetz in 1886, is very close to the Mss.
and gives fairly good sense, though it involves the use of the form
tis for tui, which seems to occur elsewhere only in Plaut. Cist. 4573
Mil. 10333 Rud. 63 Trin. 343. One may also question whether the
asseverative ne instead of the more natural immo is not rather out
of place in a reponse that eorrects a previous statement. Neither
Spengel‘s tua nor Ussing's eius is close to the Mss. and the latter
referring as it must to the son of Nicobolus leaves much to be desired
in the matter of sense. My own correction of the ne is of the Mss.
is Veneris. The whole verse will then read as follows: NI. Tua sum
