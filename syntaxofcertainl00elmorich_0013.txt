I have refrained from citing any passage containing either velim
or vellem, not because these forms do not express wish as such, but
because their interpretation in other respects is a matter of dispute.
Aside from these, howewer, it seems to me that the passages Ι have
adduced furnish sufficient evidence that the verb is one of wish in its
strict sense, as well as one of will.

As to nolle and malle it is not necessary to show in detail that
they may be placed in the same category as velle. It is to be
expected that an important meaning of the simple verb will be found
also in its compounds. Still, it may be well to quote one or two
passages. For nolo with almost the meaning of “I hope not’'. Com-
pare Pseud. 1024: Atque edepol equidem nolo3 nam illi bene volo,
For malle, which denoting preference, is used generally of ends
within the speaker’s power and so is usually a verb of will, compare
the following where the object is beyond the speaker's power. Plaut.
Bacch. 1047: Ne ille edepol Ephesi multo mavellem foret. Curc. 512:
Tacuisse mallem. Poen. 301: Bono mea ingenio esse ornatum quam
curn multo mavolo.

The next word I wish to consider is optare, in some respects the
most interesting word of its kind. It is clearly a verb of wish, but
its special shade of meaning as such is a matter on which different
opinions have been held. By some authorities optare is considered
a verb of choosing, and that from this meaning is derived the idea of
a deliberate wish for something that has been choscn, and is thus
regarded as the best of the two or more objects before the speaker's
mind. Thus Seyffert-Mueller on Cic. Lael. 16, 59 says: “optare‚ eigent-
lich wahlen, ist der XVunsch als Act der Ueberlegung und Reflexion
(fur das Beste halten)’'. This same view is held by Schultz¹, and
Tegge2. Schmidt³ on the other hand takes the ground, first, that
optare is not primarily a verb of choosing and then one of wishing,
but that the reverse of this is probably truc. Hc says: “Optio heisst
