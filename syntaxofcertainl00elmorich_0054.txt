his position in reference to the feeling sor parataxis in historical times,
it still remains that the subjunctive with velle was originally a
paratactic one. In this case those forms of the verb would be used
which would serve to repeat the meaning· of the mode in the in-
dependent subjunctive whether it were hortatory or optative. This
would exclude every form that did not express either present or
future time. With nolle and malle the corresponding forins would be
used even though the subjunctive with thern be after the analogy of
that with the tenses of velle. In this w ay the Ο6116111 ranoe of forms
employed in the construction would be deteimined3 the potential ones,
however lil< e velim and vellem offer special diffictilties, and these will

be considered in the following chapter.

Passing to other words of the group, one is met with the
question whether the subjunctive with cupere¹ is an authenticated
construction for the Republican period. As sar as the Latin of Plautus
and Terence is concerned, I am inclined to think that such is not
the case. The passage usually cited for the contrary opinion is
Plaut. Capt. 102 which in the Mss. reads as sollows2: quod quidem
ego nimis quani cupio ut impetret.

The verse, however, is defective metrically and has been emended
in various ways. Thus Brix reads cupide cupio ut·, Lindsay‚ cupio
senex ut·, Sonnenschein misere cupio ut, after Bentley, while Schoell
adopts and prints in both editions cupio fieri ut. Of these emendations
the most likely, fron] a palaeographic standpoint, is that of Brix, but
a construction can hardly be based on conjecture, especially, in this
case, as the correction of Schoell gives to cupio its usual complement
of accusative and infinitive. Another passage that may be mentioned
in this connection is Plaut. Cas. 267: CLE. Quid istuc tam cupide cupis?
LY. Ut 0111111 frugi servo detur potius quanrservo improbo, Here
the ut clause of the answer depends of course on a cupio that is to
be supplied, but the clause is a final one, expressing the purpose of
the desire rather than the desire itself. There is then in the ante-

 

is occasionally a relative pronoun and that volo or velim is itself in a deperitent clause.
The examples are in Cicero’s Letters: Att. 11. 6. 7: Tuas litteras exspecto, Quas
velim cures quam primuni ad 1116 perferenda& 13. 23. 3: Omni tibi adserveratione ad-
firmo quod mihi credas veli1n; 16 11. 4: Quem velitn cohortere et roges ut quam
primum. Fam. 9. 21. 3: Quorum imagines habeas volo. Compare also Sisenna
Frg. 117 (l’.). ln these cases parataxis seems to be clearly irnpossiblffi otherwise we
should have to assume the possibility of an optative subjunctive in a relative clause
being able to stand alone. Again when volo or velim is in a dependent clause,
relations like those of the preceding examples are elsewhere always expressed by an
accusative and infinitive, which points to subordination in these cases also,
