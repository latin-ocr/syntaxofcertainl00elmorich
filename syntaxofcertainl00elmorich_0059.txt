13. 9. 2: Volo enim te existimare3 in Fam. Ι. 9. 18: sic enim te
existimare vclim; in Fam. 2. 6. 2: Tu velim sic existimes, and in Att.
13. 32. 3: Eas litteras volo habeas. The first question is, when one
usage is to be employed and when the other.

In the answer that is usually given to this subject much strcss is
laid on the change of subject. Allen and Grcenongh in their hand
book¹ first put down the general rule that with verbs of wishing “The
lnfinitive is more common when the subject remains the same3 the
Subjunctive, when it changes”‚ but they hasten to add that “volo
and cupio tend to take the Accusative and Infinitive rather than the
Subjunctive‚ even when the subject changes'’.

Lane2 formulates the rule thus: “The accusative with the infinitive
is commonly used with volo (mab, nolo) and cupio when the subject
of the infinitive is not the same as that of the ve1·b''. Both these
statements agree with that of Draeger who in speaking of velle, nolle
and malle, says³z ι*516 haben bei ungleichen Subjecten fast tiberall
den Acc. c. Ins⁸⁷ nur zuweilen ut. Alie drei finden sich auch mit
blossem Conjunktio'⁷. This distinction, while useful as a rule of
thumb, is a purely mechanical one, and as such it does little to make
matters clear. It takes 1116 large class of cases where the subject
changes and 16115 115 11131 someimes we find the accusative and
infinitive and sometimes the subjunctive, the latter perhaps being
less frequent 111311 1116 former, but as to when we have 1116 0116
and when 1116 011161 our rule has nohing to say. Perhaps its
most definite implication is that when the subject remains the same
we do not find the subjunctive, but even this is not true.

An attempt has been made by Fisher to take the cases where
the subject changes and to work out the distinction between the two
constructions in some detail& “If the action dependent on verbs of
volition''‚ hc says, “has 3 subject different from that of the governing
verb, a distinction is made whether the predicate is passive or active.
(a) If the predicate is passive, the clause almost always has 1116 form
of an infinitive clause. (b) With an active predicate, the clause
always takes the form of an imperative clause with ut or ne, or with
imperative subjunctive without a conjunction, if the governing verb
is in the first person (generally in the subjuneive, velim, vellem, and
mereiy serve for circumlocution of an independent optative sentence).’'

Aside from this instance, the clause generally takes the form of
an infinitive clause. This is always the caseis the subject of the
dependent predicate is a thing. According to Fisher then, we find
