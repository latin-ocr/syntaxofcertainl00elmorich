the questions are about cvenly divided between these two types3 but
whatever form the clause may take, whenever the personal pronoun
of the lirst person is used, the speaker has in mind the placing of
himself at the service of another. Moreover, as the examples
containing this pronoun embrace all the cases except the few already
mentioned, this may be said to be the idea whiCh the construction is
usually employed to express.

It is worth while to insist on this in view of the fact that
Κ116111161·’51 statement of the matter is in part quite inaccurate. He
says: Bei den Komikern wird das Verb volo ungemein haufig mit
einem Akkusativ eines neutralen Pron. und dem einer Person ver-
bunden, besonders in der Frage mit der Bedeutung: Ich will etwas
von Einem, will mit Einem sprechen‚ Einem etwas sagen. As a
general statement it seems to me that the tr-uth as to the significanee
of the questions is just the reverse of this. Instead of implying that
the speaker desires to obtain something from another, they open the
way for the other to obtain something from him. Of course, where
the personal pronoun is of the second person and the verb of the
first, Kuehner⁷s view is the right one. Thus Ter. And. 536: Ausculta
paucis quid te ego velim, with which may be compared Plaut.
Bacch. 11493 As. 1093 Rud. 1216: Poen. 574. But these examples are
comparatively infrequent and ought not to be made the basis for a
general statement concerning the meaning of the construction as a
whole.

As to whether this construction is a true double accusative, only
a word need be said. With unimportant'2 excepffions, grammarians
and commentators are agreed that the two accusatives are after the
analogy of verbs of asking, and Ι 6311 566 110 good reason for not
accepting this explanation. Otherwise it would be necessary to assume
the ellipsis os some verb like facere, or to take the neuter pronouns
as accusatives of specification. The explanation from analogy seems
to me much more reasonable3 moreover, that the two objects form a
true double accusative is supported by the fact that one is the so-
called inner and the other the so-called outer object, which is also
true in the case of other double accusatives,

Before leaving the double object with velle it may be well to
refer to another construction which is sometimes called by the same
name. Examples of this usage are Cic. Fin. §.131 PrimumTheophrasti
Strato physicum se voluit. Tusc. 5. 55: Sed tamen utrum malles te,
si potestas esset, semel ut Laelium consulem an ut Cinnam quater?
and Tusc. 5. 66: Qui se non hunc mathematicum malit quam illum
