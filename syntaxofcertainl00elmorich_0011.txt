to be done if the form 01 expression always corresponded to the
real nature of the idea to be expresscd, but such is not the case.
It may suit the speaker's purpose to express what is really will by a
formula of wish and vice versa. Hardly anything is more common
than this assumption of an attitude toward some object without re-
ference to its real relation to the speaker. &Me speak 01 some end
which we 6311 1101 01 ourselves at all 3113111 35 11 11 were quite within
our power, and of something which we can control, as 11 511611 were
not at all the 6356. This fact ought to be kept especially in mind,
as we shall see, in dealing with velle. Thus in 1116 passages cited by
Bennett¹ to illustrate the use 01 volo as a verb 01 wish, it seems to
me that the speaker takes the attitude of one in authority even though
in reality he has it not, and that to all intents and purposes velle is
here a verb of will.

In deciding then, 'in any given case, whether a verb expresses
will or wish, the speaker's point 01 view ought 1161 10 be 1611 0111 01
consideration. A verb will denote will not only when it expresses
actual volition as above defined, but also when used by one who
assumes the mental attitude 01 volition. In the same way, where a
verb is used from the point of view of one who can not affect the
result, it will also be regarded as 3 verb 01 wish.

In order then to show that velle can express wish as opposed
to will, examples must be cited where the object is unattainable by
the efforts 01 the speaker, and where the latter does not assume the
stand-point 01 authority or power, which he does not really possess.
This makes the matter somewhat difficult to determine, because in
most cases there is nothing in the sentence to indicate whether the
attitude 011116 speaker toward the object of his desire is a real or an
assumed one. Still Ι think there is sufficient evidence to show that
velle is not only a verb of will, but also one of wish in the strict
sense 01 1116 latter term.

Ι will first quote some passages where velle is used in prayers3
here the speaker 6311 1101 311661 1116 result by his power, and is not
likely to assume the attitude of being able to do so. Plaut. As. 623:
Dabunt di quae velitis vobis. Cure. 658: Deos volo bene vortere
istam rem nobis Pers. 293: Eveniant volo tibi quae optas. 'l'rin. 576:
ST. Di fortunabunt vostra consilia· PH. Ita volo Cic. Fam. 15. 7. 1:
Eumque honorem tibi deos fortunare volo. (This same formula occurs
in Fam. 15. 12. 1). Closely connected with the foregoing are the
following: Plaut. Cas. 376: Si illuc quod volumus eveniet, gaudebimus.
Ter. And. 165: Sed quid opust verbis? sin eveniat, quod volo, in
Pamphilo ut nil sit morae, restat Chremes.
