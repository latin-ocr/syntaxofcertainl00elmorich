additional examples of the perfect subjunctive occur not in curses 01·
threats but in earnest wishes Cf. Plaut. Bacch. 333: CH. Tantas divitias
habet: nescit quid saciat auro. NI. Mihi dederit velim. Poen. 1206:
Velim de me aliquid dixerit. The bearing of these constructions on
the present matter will be seen when we recall first the signification
of the perfect passive infinitive with verbs like velle. It was seen that
in this construction the action of the infinitive although in the future
was looked at from the point of view of completion. If this bc true
and velim be taken as contingent we have a curious play of cross
purpose in the sentence. In one part the object desired is expressed
in such a way that its fulfillment is looked upon as already
accomplished, while the wish itself is represented as having no actual
reality, as being only a possible wish. Putting two such elements
together in the same sentence would be little less than an absurdity.
The same difficulty is met with when velim occurs with the perfect
subjunctive. This construction like that with the perfect infinitive has
practieally the force of a future perfect, the whole action being thrown
into the future by velim and represented as completed by the perfect
subjunctive. Now if velim is contingent in meaning we have the
same incongruity between the two parts of the expression, which we
have already seen in case of the perfect infinitive. It seems to me,
that neither of these construetions is possible except on the supposition
that velim has the meaning of an indicative.

If the evidence has been sufficient to establish this point ofview,
the problem then is to account for this indicative meaning of potential
forms. The theory of Morris concerning the mode of these forms,
though not itself to be accepted, suggests where the explanation of
the change of meaning is to be looked for. It is due, it seems to
me, to the occurrence of velim, vellem in paratactic sentences along
with independent optative subjunctives. Originally, then, we may
assume that these forms expressed contingent wishes and that they
were brought by parataxis into connection with independent optatives.
The latter would be the main part of the sentence, while the function
of velim, vellem, at least one function, would be to repeat the
meaning of the mode. This they would do perfectly were it not for
the idea of contingeney which they implied, but as language has never
been a logical¹ instrument, they were neverless employed. In this
function they were made to repeat the modal meaning of the inde-
pendent optative, but this modal meaning is itself a non-contingent
wish. It is, Ivthink, not unreasonable to suppose that it was this
function of repeating a non-contingent wish that brought about the
loss of the implicatior] of contingeney in velim, vellem, and gave them
