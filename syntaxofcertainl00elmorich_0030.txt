question is regarded as a real one by the person to whom it is
addressed and where it is answered by him with some special request.
The stillowing arc examples of this usage:

Plaut.Amph. 542: IUP. Numquid vis. ALC. Ut quom absim, me
ames, Amph. 544: IUP. Iam ego sequar: numquid vis? ALC.
Etiam: ut actutum advenias. Curc. 524: LV. Numquid vis, Leno.
CA. Istas minas decem qui me procurem, dum melius sit mihi, des.
Mil. 575: SC. Numquid nunc aliud me vis. PF.. Ne me noveris.
Answers of the same specific character are also found in Amph. 9703
Bacch. 6043 Capt. 1913 Epid. 5123 Men. 329, 5483 Mil. 1086, Pseud. 6653
Trin. 1923 Truc. 432. Ter. Eun. 1913 Hec. 272·‚ Ad. 432. The same
usage is found even when the verb is omitted as in Plaut. Bacch. 757.
Occasionally also the answer is a combination of the two types,
containing both a request, a parting salutation. Such is the answer
in Truc. 432: Ut quando otium tibi sit, ad me revisas, et valeas. In
Aul. 263 the text is uncertain, but if an emendation which I shall
further on propose for this passage be accepted, it will also furnish
an illustration of an answer of this mixed type.

ln addition to the substance of the answer, a point that has been
almost entirely overlooked is the mode of the verb. It will be more
convenient, however, to deal with this topic under the ‘subjunctive
with velle, and I pass it over for the present.

The formula itself, it may also be noted, is not always spoken
by the person who is taking his departure, but in some cases by the
one who remains. The latter usage, however, is a rare one, being
found only once in Terence* and twice in Plautus? In the last
passage the formula is first addressed by Curculio who is taking his
departure to Lyco, and then by Lyco who remains behind to
Curculio.

In need of correction also is the curious statement in Harper’s
LeXicon3 that numquid vis is a formula used by inferiors to their
superiors. It is impossible to base any distinction of this kind on the
facts3 the expression is used by inferiors, by equals, and also by those
of higher station. It is not necessary to give statistics of this usage.
The use of the formula by inferiors and by equals is practically the
same in point of frequency, while it is employed by superiors only
about one third as often as toward either of the other classes. This
smaller number of cases is more than, sufficient to establish the usage;
aside from this the numerical infrequency has no significance, since an

inferior is much more likely to ask for commands from a superior
than vice versa.
