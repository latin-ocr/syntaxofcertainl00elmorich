and differentiates volo veniat, “I will that he should come” from velim
veniat⁷ “I wish that he would come'⁷. In this way velim becomes
like utinam a sign of the wish. In contrast with volo it is the milder
word and it finally became almost a separate verb meaning I wish
and is used in this sense increasingly in later Latin with scarcely any
feeling of its original optative force.” Morris also holds that this use
of velim with the subjunctive precedes its use with the infinitive, the
latter construction arising after the former had become thoroughly
established.

This explanation of the mode 01 velim it may be granted is not
a priore inconceivable. It is not strange to find in Latin the influence
of attraction in number, in case, in tense, and in mode. The last is
especially interesting in this eonnecti0n3 if, in a dependent clause, an
indicative can be attracted in to a subjunctive, the same phenomenon
can not be regarded as impossible in parataxis. At the same time
there are objections to Morris' view which seems to me to make it
untenable.

In the first 111366, 11 11611111 31056 111 1116 way Morris describes and
became “a sign of a wish, an optation, parallel in the main to utinam’'‚
it is difficult to 566 how it could break away from its connection
with an independent optative and become capable of taking all the
constructions which are found with any form of velle. Moreover, in
case of some of these constructions with velim, notably those with
the infinitive, there is strong reason, 35 Bennett¹ has pointed out, for
believing that they arose in point of time before the construction
with the subjunctive. If this be true, it leaves the mode of velim,
wherever it occurs 1111111 1116 1111111111116, unaccounted for. At all events,
if velim is optative we should never expect to find it with the force
of the potential. And yet there are certain passages which must be
interpreted in this way. One of these is Plaut. As. 274: Aetatem
velim servire Libanum ut conveniam modo. Here the context shows
that velim must be contingent with the meaning of “I should be
willing'’. Another example with the same contingent force is Rud.
1322: Quid dare velis? ——‚ “what would you be willing to give?“ See
also such passages as As. 624; Cist. 1163 Stich. 4873 Truc. 362. In
none of these cases does it seems to me possible to doubt than the
meaning is a contingent one.

Again, if velim is a case of attraction why are not other instances
found under similar conditions? Thus iubeo, oportet, oportet, necesse
est, and licet are found in expressions that were originally at least
paratactic. Instead then 01 iubeo haec 11353 auferant we should
expect iubeam haec vasa auferant and so with the rest: for oportet
