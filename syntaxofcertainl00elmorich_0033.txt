This table shows that outside of Cicero an object infinitive in the
passive with these words is almost unknown, although the cases of
esse ought to be regarded in practically the same light as the passive,
but even when the two usages are taken together their aggregate is
small compared with the number of cases of the active. This
preponderance of the active in this construction is to be at least
partly explained by the idea of purpose which is so often either
expressed or implied by the words in question, and which looks
forward to an action rather than to a state of being as its appropriate
object.

The greater number of cases of the passive and of esse in Cicero
may be due in some measure to the reflective character of his
writing. Some support is given to this supposition by the fact that
this usage varies 35 we should expect in the different departments of
his work. Counting together the examples of esse and of the passive,
we find that in the philosophical works they constitute about twenty
per cent of all the object infinitives3 in the Lettch‚ seventeen per
cent, and in the Orations, less than eleven per cent. Thus we find
the usage varying with the subjective character of the writer⁷s material.
It is natural then that in Comedy, which is almost purely objective,
the least use should be made of this method of expression. The
same explanation, it seems to me, will apply to most of the remaining
authors of this period who employ any of the words of the group
with sufficient frequeney to marke their usage important. Men like
Cato, Varro, Nepos and Caesar deal more with objective themes, and
it may be for this reason that their usage differs but slightly from
that of Plautus and Terence.

It remains to speak of the object infinitive with respect to its
tense, which is usually the present. There are, however, important
examples of the perfect, but as the same usage occurs with the
accusative and infinitive as object, it will be convenient to consider it
under that head. Before taking up this construction, however, I wish
to propose a correction for the corruption in Plaut. Amph. 384,
which occurs in close connection with an object infinitive.
