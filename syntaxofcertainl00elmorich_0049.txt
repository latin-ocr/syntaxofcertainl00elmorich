Fin. 2. 8: Dicam, inquam, et quidem ‹liscendi causa magis quam quo
te aut Epicurum reprehensum velim. Plaut. Poen. 872: Nolito edepol
divellisse: iam his duobus mensibus volucres tibi erunt tuae har-
quinae. Cic. div. Caec. 21: Tamen cos defendes qui se ab omnibus
desertos potius quam abs te defensos esse malunt. l'laut. Truc. 877:
Factum cupio: nam nefacere si velim, non est locus. With these
examples compare the following sentences from S. (j. de Bacchanalibus:

Bacas vir nequis adiesse velet nisei praetorem urbanum adiesent:
Sacra in oquoltod ne quisquam fecisse velet, nisei praetorem urbanum
adieset. Sacra ne quisquam fecisse velet, neue arfuise velent nisei
de praetoris sententiad.

In connection with the accusative and infinitive construction, I
wish to propose a correction for Plaut. Bacch. 1083, which reads as
follows:

Aequom e‘sse puto: sed nimis nolo desidiae†ei dare ludum. Mss-
ei desidiae. Voss. me desidiae ei. Spengel. desidiai. Schoell.

In this anapaestic verse Philoxenus is bewailing the behavior of
his son. Still he remembers his own youth and resolves to grant the
young man some indulgence. At the same time he is very anxious
that the reins shall not be held too loosely. The corruption is in the
ej which could only be taken with desidiae, which the sense does
not permit. My correction is to read cum for ci and take it as the
subject of the inf. dare, —- I am anxious that lte shall not give loose
rein to his badness. The error I suppose to have arisen in a capital
ΜΞ. and to have begun with omission of the waved 11116 over u to
denote m. The further change of eu to ei would be almost in-
evitable.

It will be observed that in my reading enm is to be read as 3
monosyllable by synezesis. In this case e has the consonantal sound
of y¹, and the hiatus which at first sight seems to exist, is thus
avoided. The construction of nolo with acc. and inf. is too common
to need parallels.

CHAPTER lv.

In connection with the verbs under consideration there remains
still another construction, — that of the subjunctive. In frequency of
occurrence this usage is the most restricted of all, and yet there is
no other about which the grammarians make so many misstatements.
