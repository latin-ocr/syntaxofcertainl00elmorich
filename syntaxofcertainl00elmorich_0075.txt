Another use os velim which rcveals its· nrm-contingent character
is that in response to a statement of something which is regarded as
very much to the speaker‘s advantage. l think perhaps the best
illustration os this in Ter. Phor. 855 sq. Geta has just heard the secret
of Phanium's parentage and has rushed off to tell the good news to
Antipho. XVhen he meets him, Geta cries out: O omnium quantumst
qui vivont, homo hominum ornatissume‚ nam sine controversia ab dis
solus deligere, Antipho, to which Antipho rcsponds ita velim. In
Ter. Hec. 783 sq. we find something of the same kind. To Phidippus
who does not know the truth about his wife, Laches says: profecto
in hac re nil malist, quod sit discidio dignum, to which Phidippus
answers velim quidem hercle. In Plaut. Pseud. 1068 there is a scene
between Ballio and Simo. The latter has promised Pseudolus ’ΖΟ minae
on condition that he get the girl Phoenicium from Ballio, With
reference to this bargain Ballio, as if bringing a piece of good news,
says to Simo: minae viginti sanae et salvae sunt tibi, hodie quas abs
te est instipulatus Pseudolus, whereupon Simo expresses his satisfaction
in the words, velim quidem hercle. Another very interesting example
is Pers. 627 where Toxilus is urging Dordalus to purchase the
daughter of the parasite Saturio. The passage is as as follows: TOX.
Tu si hanc emeris, numquam hercle hunc mensem vortentem, credo,
servibit tibi. DOR. Ita velim quidem hercle. It seems impossible
in these examples that velim should have any potential meaning.
XVhen men are confronted with some piece of good fortune their
wish for its realization is not a conditional one. They do not say,
“I could wish under certain circumstances that it might be t1·ue'''‚ but
⁴1 do actually wish or hope for its fulfillment‘'. XVhen Geta says to
Antipho: “You are the luckiest dog alive'', Antipho replies: “I trust
I am''. And it would be in the highest degree unnatural, so far as
mode is concerned, for him to say anything else. In the same way
when Toxilius assure Dordalus that the latter will sell the girl at a
profit within a month it is hardly conceivable that Dordalus should
express a qualified wish that such might be the case. In fact in all
these passages the context is such as to make it impossible to take
velim in any other way except as having the force of an indicative¹

difference in the meaning of the two expressions. Otherwise he would not have set
thern side by side. The authority of Seneca is then io be added to that os Plautus
and Cicero.

¹ It may be urged against this view that velim in these cases is equivalent to the
English ¹⁴1 should hope so¹'‚ which is used in response to some good news. Thus is
one person says to another: “Yon are the luckiest dog alive'’, it is idiommic to reply
¹⁴1 should hope so''. It is to be remembeied. however. that we have here not the
“should'’ of contingency, but the “should'' of fimes-s. If ‘¹1 should hope so'' were the
exact equivalent of this use of velim it would be no argument for the latter’s potential
character.
