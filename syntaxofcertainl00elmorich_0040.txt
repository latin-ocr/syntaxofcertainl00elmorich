clementem holds that what is desired is not the predicate itself, but
the idea of it·, “bei cupio me esse clementcm”, he says “wird nicht
das Pradikat selbst, sondern nur die Vorstellung davon gewiinscht,
der Gedanke desselben, der Glaube daran.” C. Nauck¹ believes that
we have the accusative and infinitive when “man das Gewollte als
etwas Erkanntes und Anerkanntes wolle’², an explanation which is
also accepted by Halm on the same passage with perhaps some
confusion of thought as in connection with Nauck's remark he quotes
the quite dissimilar one of Madvig. The latter thinks that with the
accusative and infinitive “the whole circumstance which is the object
of the will and desire is conceived rather as a distinct thing in itself.⁷’
Somewhat in line with this though quite distinct from it is the con-
clusion of Gustav Mueller2 that the object of the construction is to
emphasize the subject. “Ost wird das Subject”, he says, “dem Inf.
hinzugefiigt‚ um es zu betonen und herv01·zuheben.”

This conclusion also is accepted by Kuehner³ and Draeger⁴3
Schmalffi, while holding that emphasis is aimed at, is of the opinion
that the mode of the expression has its origin in the popular
speech, -— “eine der Volkssprache entstammende Bestrebung im Inter—
esse der Deutlichkeit.''

It is not necessary to enter into a detailed criticism of the
foregoing opinions. Those of the earlier scholars especially are the
views of men who generalized without having all of the facts before
them. One can not, however, in passing refrain from expressing his
surprise at the explanation put forward by Gildersleeve—Lodge to the
effect that the accusative and infinitive is used when the action is not
within the power of the subject. Two or three examples taken at
random from Comedy would have been sufficient to show how
erroneous such a view is. Thus Plaut. As. 183: Volt placere sese amicae.
Pers. 825: Me quoque volo reddere, Diodorus quem olim faciebat in
Ionia. Truc. (5222 Guadere aliqui me volo. On the other hand one
can hardly fail to find himself in a general way in agreement with
Gustav Mueller3 at all events my own study of the material, made
without regard to his work, has led me to substantially the same
results.

The object then of the construction is to emphasize the subjeet3
and although in many cases this emphasis indicated by nothing more
specific than the context, yet there are frequent examples where it is
pointed to unmistakably by other words in the sentence. Perhaps
