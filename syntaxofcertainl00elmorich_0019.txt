questions¹. That the feeling is not a momentary also is shown by
such passages as Heaut. 425. Quanto diutius abest, magis cupio tanto,
and Poen. 1161. Iam dudum equidem cupio et te sequor?² In Plaut.
Mil. 129 and Cic. Fam. 11. 3. 4 we find the desire expressed by
cupere also denoted by the word sententia, which is a further indica-
tion that the wish is an abiding settled one.

Pas-sing now to desidex·are³, it wil be noted that this word is
usually taken to denote a longing for some absent object which the
speaker has no power to attain. It is in this sense only that it is
considered by Schmidt who makes it equivalent to the Greek ποθεῖν
and the German sehnen. This latter word⁴ denotes a desire for some
object which no human exertion can bring nearer5, one which, if it
comes at all, will either come of itself‚ or be brought by the agency
of some favoring circumstance over which he has no control.
Moreover, the object itself is frequently spiritual or, if material, is
something of noble character. It is to objects of this kind according
to Schmidt, that desiderare considered as a pure verb of wishing
relates, and in illustration he quotes Cic. Cat. M. 9, 27: ne nunc qui-
dem vires desidero adulescentis non plus quam adulescens tauri aut
elephanti deside1·abam⁰. Cf. also Cat. M. 14, 47.

There is no doubt that desiderare is used to denote longing for
absent objects, and that in this respect the traditional view is the
right one. Still, it may be supplemented in several particulars.

(a) Desiderare as a verb of wish is not always used of absent
objects, but sometimes expresses the speaker’s state of mind with
reference to what is present. This usage seems to be confined to
Comedy. Cf. Plaut. Cas. 423: Nam praesente hoc plura verba fieri
non desidero. Merc. 148: Ego bonum malum quo accedit mihi dari
haud desidero, Stich. 514: Nunc me gratiam abs te inire verbis nil
desidero. Ter. Ad. 177: SA. Quid? Nostin qui sim? ΑΕ. Non
desidero.

(b) This verb is also somewhat frequently found where the speaker
feels an assurance that the desired object will be attained, a feeling
which is evidenced by the parallel use of expectare in the same
sentence. According to the traditional view, which in the words of
Schmidt⁷ “vergleicht das Gegenwartige mit dem Abwescnden u. s. W.’'
the realization of the longing may be looked forward t0, but the
