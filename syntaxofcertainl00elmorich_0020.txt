agent sees no way of bringing it about, and in any event does not
expect almost immediate attainment. In the following passages,
howewer, the latter seems to be the case. Cf. Plaut. Mil. 1243: Sine ultro
veniat, quaeritet, desideret exspectet. Cic. Fam. 2. 14. 1: Ego res
Romanas vehementer expecto et desidero. Att. Ι. 18. 1: Qua re te
exspectamus, te desideramus, te iam etiam arcessimus. Att. 2. 25. 2:
Valde te exspectO, valde desidero.

(c) Outside of its sphere as a verb of desire, there are two rare
uses of desiderare that seem to be worth noting. One of these is
where it has the meaning of “expect’'. The only perfectly clear case
of this meaning is Cic. Att. 8. 14. 2¹: Aut quis ab iis ullam rem laude
dignam desiderat? although very like it is Fam. 8. 5. 1: Sed omnia
desiderantur ab eo qui publico negotio praepositus est. The other
case is the unique one in Plaut. Amph. 662, where desiderare means
to “regret'': An ille me temptat sciens atque id se volt experire,
suom abitum ut desiderem. Here desiderem looks not forward, but
backward, and its object, instead of being an object that is desired,
denotes the cause of the feeling of loss in the speaker's mind. The
construction probably arises from analogy of verbs of emotion that
take as an object the word that expresses the cause of the feeling.
Neither this meaning of “regret’' nor the other of “expect” is recognized
by the lexicons.

(d) It is not possible to restrict desiderare to objects of certain
kinds, though it has not so wide a range as cupere. In Comedy, of
the 12 occurrences of the word, 7 relate to persons. Cf. Capt. 316:
Quam tu filium tuom tam pater meus desiderat. In Cicero's
Letters 14 cases out of 63 refer to persons, while in the Orations there
are only 7 examples2 out of 74 cases. Desiderare more than other
verbs of wishing emphasizes the need out of which the desire arises,
and it may be applied to any object toward which the speaker wishes
to express this state of mind.

CHAPTER H.

In treating the syntax of this group of verbS, it will be convenient
to consider in order the different constructions which are found with
them. These complements take the form of nounS, of pronouns, of
object infinitives, of accusative and infiniffive, and of subjunctive
clauses, Under each of these heads there are topics that will require
