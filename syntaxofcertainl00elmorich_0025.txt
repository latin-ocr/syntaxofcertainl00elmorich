but this is not to be taken as the whole purpose, which is rather a
submissive state of mind on part of the other person. In one case
at least (Plaut. Poen. 856) we find tc volo used toward a person with whom
the speaker is already in conversation. The situation is where Milphio
is secking the aid of Syncerastus against the latter's master. After
some bandying of words, we have the verse: Ml. Apage: nescio quid
viri sis. SY. Malus sum. Ml. Tibi sis. Te volo'. Here our formula
means not “I want to speak to you’', which he is already doing, but
“I want you at my disposal, so that I may avail myself of your
services''.

. This more general meaning is also felt in the interrogative quis mc
volt.> which occurs in Ter. And. 872 and Heaut. 743. Here the
commentators do not think in necessary to point out that some in-
finitive is understood, nor judging solely from examples of this kind
would any one be likely to obtain the impression that such was the case.

Again, the fact that te volo means more than a mere desire to
address another is indicated oceasionally in the responses of the persons
addressed. Thus in Plaut. Capt. 978 we have the answer: Hegio, assum:
siquid me vis, impera and in As. 639: si quid vis, both indicating
that they have received a command to put themselves at some one’s
disposal. The most interesting case of this kind is Trin. 1060 where
in response to Charmides te volo, Stasimus answers Quid, si ego, me
te velle nolo?, — suppose Ι object to your wanting me¹ —— and then
adds emere meliust quoi inperes.

Here Brix would understand conloqui but if this be so, it must
be taken not only with volo but also with velle. Then te velle
nolo will be for te velle me conloqui nolo, which seems unlikely.
What Stasimus objects to, is not so much the tone of a particular
request, as the general attitude of authority which Charmides assumes
in his te volo. This is borne out also by the quoi inperes of the
following verse.

After all why should any one resort to the doubtful method of
ellipsis to explain this construction when velle shows unquestioned
examples of personal pronoun objects. Compare the following: Plaut.
Cure. 147: Vosamo, vos volo, vos peto, atque obsecro. Mil. 1070:
Facis nunc ut facerest aequom, quom quae te volt eandem tu vis.
Mil. 1386: Te volt, te quaerit, teque expectans expetit. Cic. div.
Caecil. 22: At enim solum id est ut me Siculi maxime velint. There is
also one example of cupere, Plaut.Mil. 1050: ΡΥ. Quid nunc tibi vis, mulier,
memora· MI. Ut quae te cupit earn ne spernas. Compare also
Mil. 1040 where the object is a demonstrative. In these passages the
desire is of a somewhat different character from that involved in te
