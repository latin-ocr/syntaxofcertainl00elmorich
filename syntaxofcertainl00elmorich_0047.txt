Dracger', not to mention other grammarians, hold the same view as
Madvig, so that the weight of authority at least is against the aoristic
use. lloward2, moreovcr, has shown that the use of the perfect active
infinitive in the sense of the present is capable of explanation without
resorting to the hypothesis of a Latin aorist. It is in fact a
development of an earlier usage in which the perfect infinitive retains
a part at least of its ordinary function.

It seems to me without going· into details there is not evidence
to warrant a belief in the aoristic explanation of this construction. It
is rather a means of expressing a desire for the completion of some
future action or state. The future idea is contained in the governing
verb while the completion of the action or state is expressed in the
ordinary way by the perfect infinitive, the whole expression placing
emphasis on a result rather than on a process as is the case when
the present infinitive is employed. Mox-eoves, there is no greater
difficulty in having the perfect infinitivo refer to a relative future than
exists in the case of the present. The latter, when used with verbs
like velle, instead of being contemporaneous⁷ is really subsequent in
its action to that of the governing verb. Compare the expression
volo te id facere, in which the doing on the part of the person
addressed takes place after the expression of the speaker’s will. In
fact, the meaning of verbs of wish and will is such as to make this
use ot the present infinitive necessary, and there is no reason why
the perfect cannot be employed in the same way. This view of
the perfect infinitive with verbs of wish and will to denote the corn-
pletion of the desired action was held as early as Perizonius who
says:³ “Infinitivus iunctus verbo volo notat simpliciter ipsam cuiuscum-
que rei actionem, quae futuri temporis forma non exprimitur. Nam
quis unquam dixit aut scripsit volo hoc facturum esse, sivi me, sivi
te, sivi illum. Siquid futuri in hac inest locutione, id haeret in verbo
volo, quod suam certae actionis voluntatem extendit a praesenti
temporis momento usque in illud, quo ea actio tandem fit, aut desi-
derata res sibi obvenit. Deinde sola hac perfecti temporis forma
videtur aliqua certe temporis distinctio plerumque notavi. Nam volo
te emisse notat, non volo te velle et incipere emptionem sed te eam
inibi factam et absolutam praestare''. In this passage, Perizonius sees
clearly that while velle with the present infinitivo is equivalent to a
future, isit be joined with the perfect infinitive, it has the force of a
future perfect. Substantially the same view is held by Roby*‚ Madvig-⁵,
