A cmnparison of these lists throws an interesting light on the
use 01 esse in this construction. It is usually held that in the great
majority of cases the perfect participle stands alone. This is the
opinion of Kuehner', Draeger2, Schmalffl, Gildersleeve-Lodge⁴‚ and
Lane5, who in speaking of this use 01 1116 infinitive employ such
expressions as “gethnlich ohne esse''. “Fast immer steht das passiv
Particip allein ohne esse’', “meist ohne esse”, “usually without esse”,
and “esse is seldom expressed”. As a matter of fact, as far as
Republican literature 1s concerned, these expressions are much
stronger than the facts warrant. Of 110 cases 01 1116 construction
with velle, 36 have the full form and 74 the participle only. In
Comedv, the examples with esse, speaking still of velle only, bear 3
somewhat smaller propotion to those without it, but in Cicero the
former category is actually the larger one. Cupere, however, which
is next to velle in point of frequency, prefers the participle alone,
standing so in Io out of 14 cases. Nevertheless it is the fact that
this usage of the participle with esse, instead of never occuring at all
or of being confined to isolated cases, is a very important construction,
and where velle is concerned, the favorite one of Cicero.

The first question that arises concerning the interpretation of this
infinitive is whether it is a true perfect or an aorist. One reason 101·
believing the infinitive to be 311 301151 15 1116 1361 11131 11 expresses-
action which, with reference to the governing verb, belongs to the
future, while a true perfect belongs to a relative past. An aorist,
however, which in respect to time can be used for the present, could
stand without difficulty in the relation to the governing verb, which
this construction requires. Then again we have the usage of writers
of a later period and especially of the Augustan poets, who frequently
employ the perfect active infinitive with the meaning of the present.
The theory of a Latin 301151 1135 been most strongly held by W'exss,
and it seems also to have the support of Delbrticl<⁷ who says, “Dem
Griech. Inf. Aoristi entspricht der aoristische Inf. des Perf.” This-
view has not been widely accepted. Its most conspicuous opponent
is Madvig& who after quoting the expression me conventam
esse expetit, says: “Haec adeo ab aoristi differunt quocum com-
parantur, ut si quid simile Graece fingere velis, perfecto necessario
utendum sit ad exemplum Herodoti illius (2. 173).” Holtse and
