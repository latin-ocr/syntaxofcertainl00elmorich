imperative¹, or a subjunctive2 clause. These usages are illustrated in
the three following passages: Ter. Ad. 432: ΒΥ. Numquid vis.> DE. Men-
tem vobis meliorem dari. Plaut. Men. 914: ME. Quid vis? MED. Dic mihi
hoc quod te rogo3 Amph. 544: Iul). Numquid vis? AL. Etiam: ut
actutum advenias. Taking all the cases in Plautus and Terence, and
this kind of question and ansxver occurs no where else in the
Republican period, we find 4 examplcs of the infinitive, 17 of the
imperative and 32 of the subjunctive³. The subjunctive is thus by
fai· the most common of the three idioms. It is to be explained as
referring to a velle to be supplied from the vis of the preceding
questi0n3 but if this be true we have also to explain the extraordinary
frequency of ut. In its ordinary use in Comedy velle is followed by
ut in only 18 out of 105 cases with the subjunctive, in this idiom
the proportion is almost reversed, there being 24 examples of ut
and the subjunctive out of a total 32 cases of the subjunctive con-
struction. It seems to me that this unusal frequency of ut is due
to a feeling of the speaker that something is necessary to mark the
connection between the answer and the preceding question, and ut is
the word that serves this purpose. Occasionally, as in Plaut.
Merc. 622, the answer is in the form of a substantive subjunctive clause
in apposition with 3 demonstrative pronoun and ut is necessary 011
this account, but as a rule its presence is due to the demands ot
clearness.

Before leaving the subject I wish to apply a knowledge of this
particular subjunctive construction with volo understood to the
solution of two difficulties, a textual and a grammatical one. The
first is found in Plaut. Aul. 263. This verse occurs at the end of a
conversation between Megadorus and Euclio. Megadorus, having been
persuaded by his sister to marry, has just concluded a formal request
to Euclio for the hand of the latter's daughter, and Euclio has
reluctantly given his consent. Then Megadorus answering that he
will go and make preparations takes his leave with the question num-
quid me vis? It is in Euclio's response to this that the corruption
exists. This whole verse together with the principal changes that have
been proposed reads as follows:
