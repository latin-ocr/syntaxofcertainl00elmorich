to, but the part played by the perfect infinitivo in the espression of
the same thought is seldom if ever mentioned, and yet it will be
seen to be a very important construction.

Under the second head are to be included a few cases o,f the
perfect active infinitive which expressing the state that results from

the action of the verb, have the meaning of the present¹. They are
such passages as follow2. Lucil. 145: Ut perisse velis quem visere
nolueris. Cic. Verr. 2. 149: Nemo eorum est qui non perisse te

cupiat. Verr. 3. 180: Vide, quaere, circumspice siquis est forte ex ea
provincia in qua tu triennium praefuisti qui te nolit perisse. Frag.
10. 7: Etsi stellarum motus cursusque vagantis nosse velis ......
omnia iam cernes divina mente notata. Lucret. 3. 69: Unde homines
dum se falso terrore coacti effugisse volunt, longe longeque remosse.
The perfect infinitives in the last passage have been otherwise ex-
plained, but there seems little doubt that they are to be accounted
for in the same way as perisse and nosse in the other examples-
This is even the view of Wex³ whose theory of an aorist use of the
perfect infinitive would naturally lead him, if possible, to another
interpretation.

In a third class I have placed the examples of the perfect in-
finitive wherein, roughly speaking, it is used for the present, or where,
in other words, the present would be expected. This is a most
important category, the usage with verbs of wish and will being much
more widely extended than the treatment of grammarians would lead
us to believe. It is, however, only in the passive voice that this use
of the infinitive is found with great frequency. Omitting the
S. C. de Bacchanalibus there are only ten examples of the active in
the whole Republican period, viz: Plaut. As. 77: Volo amori obsecutum
illius (bracketed by Goetz and Schoell). Ter. Hec. 563: Interdico ne
extulisse extra aedis puerum usquam velis. Cato de Agr. 5. 4: Nequid
emisse velit insciente domino, nequid dominum celavisse velit, Chal-
daeum nequem consulisse velit. Frg. 15. Ι (Cor.): Honorem me
deum immortalium velim habuisse. C. Gracchus 9. 3 (Cor.): Caleni
ubi audierunt edixerunt, nequis in balneis lavisse vellet cum magistra-
tus Romanus ibi esset. Varro ap. Non. (p. 394): Nequis lictorem
spureum hominem liberum prehendere iussisse velit. Cic. Att. Io. 2. 2:
Dionysium nollem ad me profectum. Plaut. Poen. 872: Nolite edepol
divellisse. Cornif. 4. 47: Is optet istum maximas poenas dedisse. Sall.
Or. Cot. 12: Volentem animam dono dedisse. On the other hand
