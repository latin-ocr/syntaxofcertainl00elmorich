This is evidently the opinion of Schmidt,¹ who in discriminating
between verbs that express wish, makes no mention of velle. Morris2
holds that it is only such forms as velim, vellem that are not volitio-
nal, and that these came into existence because wish in the strict
sense could not be expressed by the other forms of the verb. Bennett3
on the other hand believes that velle is used with some frequeney as
a verb of wish, though the examples cited by him do not by any
means establish this contention.

It is obvious that in a question of this kind, the answer will
depend partly on the distinction that is made between wish on the
one hand and will on the other. Delbriicl<,4 who felt the need of
this distinction in his studies on syntax, comprehends as I have already
mentioned, both wish and will under the general notion of desire
(Begehrung). Desire he defines substantially as an idea or a con-
ception of something in the future, which is attended in consciousness
with a feeling that the object conceived is desirable. If the object
is attainable, this state of mind with reference to it is called will, it
unattainable wish.5

There is no doubt that the attainability or unattainability of the
object is the most suitable basis for this distinction, since it avoids
psychologieal detail, and yet is psychologically sound. In fact it is
the general distinction which James himself adopts, and it may be ex-
pressed in his words: “If with the desire there goes a sense that
attainment is not possible, we simply wish, but if we believe that the
end is in our power, we will that the desired feeling, having or doing
shall be real.'' In other· words a wish does not contemplate action on
part of the speaker, since there is nothing he can do to bring about
the desired result, will, on the other hand, does look forward to action
if any be necessary beyond the expression of the volition, since it
is the purpose of the speaker who believes that a certain end is
within his power, to effect its realization.

This distinction sufficiently differentiates the two mental states,
but, in making use of it for our purpose, allowance must be made
for the influence of the speaker’s point of view. This would not need

5 There are one or two details of Delbrtick’s analysis which are open to criticism.
After making the general distinction given in the text, he adds that one may wish both
for the attainable and the unattainable. — “Man wtinscht eben Erreiehbares und Uner—
reichbaresj’ This statement seems to do away with the distinction he is seeking to
establish, Mmeover, Delbriick’s ¹‘Begehrung¹’ is an abstraction, though he seems to
imply that it is an actual mental state when he says that will and wish are kinds of
“Hegehrung —— da sie eben Arten der Begehrung sind.’' Still, the inelusion of both
will and wish under the broader term of desire is convenient and useful.
