tyrannum? Constructions of this type, Merguet in his lexicon classifies
as double objects, without, however, in my opinion, having any
reason for such a classification. It is much better to understand 6556
and to take the accusative and infinitive as the object of velle and
malle rather than the individual words. 11 may a'lso 116 noted here
that this construction with a noun and a pronoun or two nouns as
the objects is a rare one} With a noun and adjective, howewer, it is
not infrequent both in Comedy and in Cicero¹3 but when the ad-
jective is replaced by a noun, the cases are few. The only certain
example of the latter in Comedy is Ter. Phor. 582: Ille 51 1116 311611115
adfinem volet, tacebit, dum intercedet familiaritas? In Cicero the con-
struction 15 found only in the passages 1 have quoted 3.

In connection with the double object, 1 wish 10 offer an emen-
dation of a corruption which occurs in the same verse with a con-
struction of this kind.

The passage is Plaut. Bacch. 1149. 11 0661115 111 3 scene where the old
men Nicobulus and Philoxenus in search of their sons appear before
the house of the Bacchides. The old men, who finally threaten to
break the door down if they are not admitted, are at first made much
sport ot by the women. But one of the latter at length conceives
the idea of wheedling the old men out of their hostility, and so calls
her sister to her in order to impart to her the new plan. It is in
11115 11116 11131 1116 difficulty with the text occurs, BA. Soror e'st quod
te volo se‘creto. SO. Eho†amabo. NI. Quo illae abeunt. Thus the
editio minor. BA. Soror est quod te volo secreto. ΞΟ. Eho amabO.
NI. Quo illaec abeunt. Bothius and Ritschl. BA. Soror est quod te
volo secreto. SO. Eho amabo. NI. Quo illae 111116 311611111. Hermann.
BA. Soror est quod te volo secreto. SO. Eho, amabo, dic. Quo
illae abeunt. Seyffert.

The objection to all these readings is that eho as it stands here
does not make sense. One sister calls another to her and when the
latter arriveS, she remarks according to these texts, “Look here now,
please’', which is obvious nonsense.

Richter, in his study of eho refers* to this passage to say that
in his opinion it is corrupt, but strangeley enough none of those who
have emended the passage, except Seyffert, seem to think that eho

 

¹ e. g. Cic. Tusc. 5. 52: At nos virtutem semper liberam volumus.

2 Cf. Plaut. True. 859 for the same idion] with optare, and see Weissenborn on
Livy 21. 42. 2.

3 With desiderare the construction occurs in Cic. Catil. 1. 10, Phil. 2. 26, Tusc.
4· 52; Off. 1. 65.

4¹ See his ireatment of eho in Studernund's Studia in Prisc. Seript. Lat. 1. 445 ff.
and the following reference to this passage in 1. 451 note. Sed cum eho utantur ii
qui alterum vocant, ut aliquid interrogent vel iubeant, nusquam ii qui ab altero vocati
sunt. He then goes on to say that Seyffert’s conjecture of dic is not improbable.
