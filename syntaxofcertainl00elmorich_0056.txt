that it is not only a mannerism of his style, but also surpasses in
frequency all 1116 011161 uses of the subjunctive with this class of verbs
both in his own writings and in Comcdy. In the same way vellem
and mallem in connection with the imperfect and pluperfect sub-
junctives are much more common in Cicero than in the comic poctS.
In general it may be said that with the subjunctive construction the
potential forms of velle, nolle and malle are the more prevalent in
Cicero and the indicative ones the more 50 111 Comedy. The case
of velim and its preponderance over volo is easily explained, being
due of course to Cicero's desire for a mode expression that sub-
ordinates‚ as much a possible, the will of the speaker. It reflects the
polites usages of social intercourse, and while it 15 1101 unknown to
the characters of Comedy, it 15 natural that it should find its greatest
scope in Cicero's LetterS. ’

Α word may also be said concerning the presence or absence of
ut with the subjunctives that are found in connection with the forms
mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

As far 35 velle is concerned, the proportion 01 subjunctives with ut
is, owing to Cicero's excessive use 01 velim with the simple subjunctive,
greater in Comedy than in the classical writers. For malle the number
of cases is so small that comparison is almost out of the question.
With nolle there is no case of ut and the subjunctive in the whole
of Republican literature2. Any comparison therefore of usage with
respect to ut ought really to be confined to the forms 01 velle, which
as 3 11131161 01 1361 111 early Latin does make a proportionally greater
use of the ut construction than in the later period.

In regard to the usage of Cicero, Gildersleeve-Lodge3 make the
broad 3556111011 11131 “with the Potentia] forms 11611111, malim, vellem,
mallem, Cicero uses only the subjunctive (without ut)⁷’. We have
already seen how unfounded is the first part of this statement, which
would restrict these forms to the subjunctive construction3 the second
part which confines thern to the subjunctive without ut is also not in
accordance with the facts. For velim compare the following passages⁴2
Cic. Att. 2. Ι. 12: Deligenter Latinos ut conserves velim3 Io. 16. 1:
Velim ut tibi amicus sit. Fam. 4. Ι. 2: quue ut facias velim3

the subjunctive with or without ut. Cf. De Monte, Lat. Rest. ΙΙΙ, 1314, who believed
that the forms volo and nolo with 1116 Suij. always had ut.
