optabam ab dis immortalibus. Imp. Pomp. 48: Qui ab dis immortali-
bus tot et tantas res'tacitus auderet optare.

This, I think, is sufficient to establish the peculiar force¹ of optare
as a verb of wishing, but Schmidt's view that this meaning comes
from the fact that this verb is employed so often in wishes for others,
and in those directed to the gods seems to rne unfounded. As a
matter of fact, optare is not often used with reference to the gods?2
I have quoted above all the cases of this kind and their number is
not large. Nor is it peculiarly appropriate in wishes for others. It
seems much more likely that its general subjective character should
lead to its employment in cases of this kind than that these cases
should color the whole significance of the word. But even granting
Schmidt⁷s position, the question would still remain as to how this
particular word came to be used toward the gods. On the other
hand, I can see no great difficulty in deriving the subjective character
of optare from an original idea of choosing. What is chosen is not
only desired, but being considered as the most desirable of all the
objects of choice, it may easily pass over into what is ideally
desirable — what one would wish for if wishes were realities. From this

idea all the varieties of wish mentioned in the preceeding paragraph
could easily be derived.

Optare is also a verb of will, but this usage needs only a word.
Under this head belong those cases where the verb has the meaning
of choose, and where the object of choice is regarded as within the
speaker's power. Plaut. Mil. 669: Quid ad illas artes optassiS, si optio
eveniat tibi? Rud. 854: Utrumvis opta, dum licet. Cic. Brut. 189:
Cui patroni daretur optio, quin aut Antonium optaret aut Crassum.

The number of cases where optare means to choose is surpris-
ingly small3, and show how far from the truth are those who would
make it the dominant signification of the word.

After optare it is convenient to turn for a moment to cupere,
whose range and special shades of meaning have received very little
discussion.

It is usually thought sufficient to point out that cupere expresses
a strong and passionate wish. Thus Seyffert-Mueller* defines it as
“der Drang des begehrenden GemiitheS, daher o'fters auch ein heftiges

leidenschaftliches Verlangen (wunschenswerth finden).⁷⁷ Tegge5, who

 

¹ In view of this fact, Klotz's Conjecture of opto in Cic. Fani. 8. 3. 3 is very
unlikely.

² Cf. Verg. Aen. 1. 76 where optare refers to what Juno may herself desire: tuus,
o regina, quid othS, explorare labor.

3 Cf. As. 720; Aul. 11; Cic. Sest. 47; Phil. 13, 1.
