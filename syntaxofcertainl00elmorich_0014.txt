die wahl, d. h. die facultas eligendi. Daraus geht noch keineswegs
hervor, dass das einfache optare (mit adoptare und cooptare ist es
etwas Anderes) auch irgend eine Beziehung darauf habe, dass man
etwas als das Bessere von Anderem aussucht: denn sehon zeigt uns,
wie leicht sich bei jedem Wunsch oder Willen eine Beziehung auf Be-
vorzugung von Auderem einstellt.'’ Schmidt also holds that optare
as a verb of wish is equivalent to the German “wunscheffl and
implies that the sulfillment of the wish depends either on the power
of another or on relations external to ourselves. That optare has this
special shade of meaning is due, according to Schmidt¹, to the fact
that it is so often used of wishes which we. entertain for others and
of those which we address to the gods. Reid2 also calls attention to
optare in wishes impossible of attainment, a special case of this being
its use with reference to the wild theories propounded by the
philosophers.

The question whether optare is primarily a verb of will or one
of wish, need not be discussed here. It seems to me that there is
not sufficient evidence for Schmidt's position, although in addition to
the case of βούλεσθαι 111 Greek he might have cited the occasional
use of velle in the sense of malle³³. Moreover in his treatment of
optare Schmidt does not put as much stress as the facts warrant on
the especially subjective character of the wish that is expresscd by
this verb. It is in fact the wish as such, being opposed to reality‚
and wholly untrammeled by considerations of fulfillment, — the wish of
ideals both intellectual and moral, the wish also that is directed to
the gods. The evidence for this position is somewhat as follows:

(a) The use of optare to denote a state of mind more removed
from reality than that denoted by sperare. Compare Ter. Eun. 605:
An ego occasionem tam brevem, tam optatam, tam insperatam
amitterem. Cic. Att. 8. 15A. 1: Magis opto quam sperO. Att. 11. 19. 2:
Cogis me sperare quod optandum vix est. Fam. 2. 18. 3: Qui Si SC
dignum maioribus suis praebuerit, ut spero et opt0‚ tua laus ex ali-
qua parte fuerit. Fam. 4. Ι. 2: Venire in mentem nihil potest non
modo quod sperem, sed vix iam quod auderem optare. Fam. 5. 8. 2:
Sed extitit tempus optatum mihi magis quam speratum⁴. Balb. 9:
Quem liberi populi castiorem, moderatiorem, sanctiorem non modo
viderunt, sed aut sperando umquam aut optando cogitaverunt?⁵.
