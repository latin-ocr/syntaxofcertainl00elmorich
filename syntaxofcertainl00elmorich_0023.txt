-15—

It may be objected that if the meaning of velle for example,
tends toward the absence of noun objects, the same influence would
operate in the case of pronouns. This would be true if the pronouns
always referred to definite noun antecedents‚ but this is far froin
being the case. As a matter of fact, it could be shown, if nesessary.
that most of these pronouns either have no antecedent expresscd. or
refer to some form (usually a neuter one) of is, and that in either
case what the speaker has in mind in most instances is an action and
not an object. This is seen in such passages as Plaut. Merc. 158: Ae.
Quid vis faciani? CHA. Tun? Id quod volo. This is also illustrated
in the formula numquid me vis? Which is an offer not to give
something, but to perform some service. However, I have spoken of
the influence of the meaning of the verb only as a strong tendency,
and as it does not prevent some nouns from being used as objects,
so also some pronouns that do not represent action may stand in the

same construction.

In addition to this general view there are one or two constructions
in connection with these pronouns that require special notice. One is
the use of personal pronouns in such expressions as te volo¹‚ the
question being whether the pronoun is the object of some verb
understood, such as conloqui or convenire, or whether it is to be
taken directly with velle or whatever verb of will and wish may happen
to stand in the sentence. The construction is a colloquial one and
is practically confined to Comedy2, though Cicero has one or two
cases of a similiar character.

In explaining the construction of the pronoun the editors3 as a
rule assume an ellipsis of the verb. In this they are supported by
the fact that such ellipses are very common with cupere, nolle, and
velle. This fact is apparent without the special study that would be
required to define the limits within which the ellipsis is allowed. For
cupere a good example is Plaut. Cure. 305: CV. Quis vocat? Quis
nominat me? PH. Qui te conventum cupit. CV. Haud magis cupis
quam ego te cupio. For nolle cf. Cas. 544: AL. Vin vocem? CLE.
Sine eam: te nolo, si occupatast. W1th velle the omission of the verb

is illustrated in the following passages:

¹ Cf. Plaut. Capt. 977: Exi: te volo. Cist. 705: Bona femina et malus masculus
volunt te. Cure. 687: At ego vos nolo ambos. Ter. Heaut. 619: Te volt‚· videas
quid velit.
