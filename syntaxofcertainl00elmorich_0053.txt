for the promisisse nollem, 01 k. they read promisisset nollem. It 15
3150 well to note the instances' of the form nolo in coordination with
the subjunctive. It is an evidence of the antiquated character of
Harper's lexicon that this construction, which is so well established,
especially for early Latin, is not even recognizcd2.

The reason why the subjunctive is confined to so few forms of
velle, nolle, and malle, is to be found in the origin of the construction.
which was undoubtedly the coordination of two independent verbs by
the method of parataxiS. The extent of this parataetic usage and
the degree to which it was felt in historical times as such are matters
of dispute. Bennett³ holds in opposition to Morris⁴ that the sub-
junctive with nolo is not of paratactic origin and that expressions of the
type of nolo ores, (Flam. Most. 1176) and nolo ames (Plaut. Cas. 233) are
after the analogy of volo ames, Bennett also maintains against Morris
that even where there had been an original parataxis the feeling sor
it had mostly passed away. “For my own part⁷'‚ he says, “I am
firm in the belief, that, sor the subjunctive, the paratactic stage had
been passed centuries before Plautus, just as it had well nigh
disappeared in the Greek of Homer's day3 a very few cases occur
which may perhaps be vindicated as paratactic3 but, in the main, Ι
am convinced that for Plautus as for Terence, Cicero and the later
Latins‚ the great body of subjunctive expressions of the type claimed
by Morris as paratactic were really felt as subordinate and dependent.
Ibelieve this because Ι am constrained by the considerations just
advanced to believe it for expressions of the type nolo ames.” In
this dispute‚ Ι need not take sides at this point, though it seems to
me it must be admitted that Bennett's contention in regard to nolo
ames is well founded-⁷³. But even if this be true and granting also
