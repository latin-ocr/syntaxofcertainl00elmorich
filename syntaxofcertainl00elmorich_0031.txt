11 15 only in rare cases that the tone of the question is distincly
unsriendly; in fact Ι have obscrved only the three tollowing passages
in which this tone is noticeable: l’laut. Bacch. (io-i: ΡΑ. Numquid
vis? ΡΙ. Abeas. Epid. 512: Fr. Numquid me vis ceterum? PE.
Malo cruciatu ut pereas atque abeas cito. Men. 328: CY. Numquid
vis? ΜΕΝ, Ut cas maxumam malam crucem.

In respect to 1110 form of the question there is an occasional
variation ¹. In Pers. 735 and Truc. 432, we find numquippiam in the
place of the usual numquid, while in Pers. 693 and 709, voltis appears
instead of vis. Here also may be noted the three interesting cases in
which the formula is employed to ask speeifie questions, which it is
enabled to do by the addition of a quin clause. The instances are Plaut.
Amph. 970: Numquid vis quin abeam iam intro? Cist. 117: Numquid
me vis, mater, intro quin eam, and Ter. And. 247: Numquid vis
quin abeam? The use of the quin clause not only makes the question
3 specifie one, but also illustrates the essentially negative character of
the formula.

CHAPTER HI.

The next construction I wish to take up is that of the com-
plementary infinitive. Here as in the case of other forms of object
which we have already considered, we find the construction employed
in varying degree with different words of the group. With desiderare
and optare it hardly occurs at all. This is especially true of
desiderare. In one passage in Comedy2‚ the infinitive may be easily
understood, but it is nowhere expressed, and outside of this passage
it 15 nowhere implied. In Cicero there are three examples; de
Or. 2. 213: Homines prius ipsum illud proprium sui iudicii audire
desiderant. Sext. Rosc. 104: Nunc quid est quod quisquam ex vobis
audire desideret, and N. D. Ι. 65: Haec enim scire desidero

Outside of Cicero desiderare with object infinitive is not found in
Republican literature. These three cases, however, are worth noting
as showing both that 1110 construction is an actual one, and that the
Lexicons are not to be trusted which cite the first examples of the
