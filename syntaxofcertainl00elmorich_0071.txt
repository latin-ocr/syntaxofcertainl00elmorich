the earlier usage. In the ease of Sat. 2. 6. 92: Vis tu homines ur-
bemque feris praeponere silvis, the usage is not so ‹lecisive‚ but still l
think vis tu ought to bc changed to vin tu. The question here is
undoubtedly an exhortation, and it is equally certain that only in
the rarest cases in Republican literature does vis tu introduce a
question of this kind. Vin tu, on the other hand would be especially
suitablc in this place where it would be pcrfectly in harmony with
its usage as we have already seen it. Nevertheless the Bacchides
example already quoted and certain passages in Seneca and Livy
leave the matter in doubt. The change in either case from the point
ofview of palaeography is a slight one, which could easily be ovcrbalanced
by established usage.

XVhen considered in themselves without reference to any dependent
construction the forms velim, vellem give rise to two interesting
questions, one of which has to do with the mode and the other, with
the meaning. As to the first the main point to be determined is
whether there is sufficient reason for departing from the traditional
view that these forms belong to the potential subjunctive as the mode
of contingent action.

This traditional view has· recently been called in question by
Morris in the course of three articles on “The Subjunctivc in In-
dependent Sentences in Plautus'' ¹. Mori-is finds that in Plautus the
independent velim occurs 44 times, 17 of these cases being followed
by the subjunctive, 10 by the infinitive‚ 7 by participle and adjective,
4 by object, while 6 are used absolutely. “In more than half of
these cases’', he sayS, “the context of the sentence is a curse or a wish
which involves a threat.’' Thus in Plaut. Stich. 6133 we find: edepol te
hodie lapide percussum velim and Rud. 662: Nimis velim impro-
bissumo homini malas edentaverit. Now if velim is used in modest
and cautious statements as its potential origin requires, it is curious to
find it in threats and curses where contingency or modesty or caution
is out of the question.

On account of this difficulty mainly, Morris seeks another origin
for the mode of velim, and comes to the conclusion that it is optative
and not potential. It is not, however, an ordinary optative but an
optative by attraction. “I should explain it'’, he says, “as having arisen
by attraction through parataxis. The simple subjunctive veniat is
frequently so indefinite as to call for a defining addition. Alone veniat
might mean, “tell him to come’', “let him come'', “make him come'',
or “I wish he would come”, Of the various paratactic additions
which supply the needed definition, volo emphasizes the will, while
velim repeating the mode of veniat, the modal force of the optative
