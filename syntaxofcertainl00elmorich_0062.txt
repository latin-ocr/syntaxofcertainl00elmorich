certain expressions of similar meaning both may be found. Thus
velim existimes and velim te existimare, which I have already quoted,
may be taken as the type of this overlapping. But between the two
expressions there is a real difference of meaning. Each expresses a
xvish, but the accusative and infinitive is somewhat more insistent than
the subjunctive. The latter is not only optative in itself, but is rein-
forced by the verb of wishing, so that the optative tone is stronger
than with the infinitive. This same principle Ι think will hold good

for all expressions of a similar kind.
An idiom which deserves a word is that of the subjunctive with

or without ut, after malle quam¹. With malle, quam is more often
omitted than expressed, but when it is expressed‚ and is preceded by
an infinitive depending on malle, an infinitive also usually follows.
This is the almost uniform practice of the whole period. Still, there
are some exceptions: Cf. Plaut. As. 121: Morire sese misere mavolet quam
non perfeetum reddat quod promiserit. As. 811: Emori me malim
quam haec non eius uxori indicem. Aul. 661: Emortuom ego me
mavelim leto malo quam non ego illi dem hodie insidias seni. Truc. 742:
Mortuom hercle me quam ut id patiar mavelim. Cic. verr. Ι. 165:
Malebat pecuniam accipere quam ut hoc edictum interponeret. XVhen
malle takes the subjunctive and quam is expressed the second member
of the comparison is a subjunctive. Cf. Plaut. Poen. 1150: Facias modo
quam memores mavelim. Poen. 1184: Malim istuc aliis ita videatur
quam ut tute, soror, conlaudes. Trin. 762: Malim hercle ut verum
dicas quam ut des mutuom. Ter. Heaut. 928: Immo abeat potius
malo quovis gentium quam hic per flagitium ad inopiam redigat
patrem. Cic. Att. 7. 3. 4: Mallem tantas ei viris non dedisset, quam
nunc tam valenti resisteret3 Att. 8. 9. 4: Idem aiebat nihil malle
Caesarem quam ut Pompeium adsequeretur. The last example is
quoted here for convenience even though quam is not preceded by a
subjunctive.

Another interesting use of the subjunctive with velle, which has
not received the attention it deserves, is that which is found with
considerable frequency in the answers to questions of the type of
quid vis? or numquid vis. These answers appear in several forms.
Sometimes the response is not a direct one, the person addressed
replying with a statement2 or with another question ²³. When, however,
a direct answer is given, it is always expressed by an infinitive 4, an
