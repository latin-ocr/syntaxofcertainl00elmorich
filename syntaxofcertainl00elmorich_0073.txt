sit diligens we should find oporteat; sor necesse est confitearis,
necesse sit, and sor licet abeas, liccat abeas. ln addition to these
illustrations‚ which are taken from Bennett's discussion of this point,
it may be asked why if velim is the result of attraction, other forms
of the verb, especially volo, when brought into connection with the
subjunctive are not affected in the same way. It is hard to see more
reason for attraction in the one case than in the other.

Nor does it seem to me that thc use of velim in threats and
curses is inconsistent with its being a potential form. Let us sup-
pose that it has always a contingent force, which does not at all
imply that it expresses a mild and cautious statement, it could still
be employed in outbursts of passion. The fact is that curses are
often conditional. A good example of an imprecation with the con-
tingency expressed is Plaut. Most. 192: Di deaeque omnes me pessu-
mis exemplis interficiant, nisi ego illam anum interfecero. With velim
in expressions of this kind izo protasis is ever expressed, but assuming
that the contingency is felt by the speaker, we can still understand
how this potential form may be employed in this connection. Thus
in Most. 217: In anginam ego nunc me velim vorti, it is a possible
interpretation (I do not say a correct one) to take velim in the
contingent sense of “I could wish”. In English one may say of
another: “I could wish he were dead.’' “I could wish that some
misfortune would overtake him’‘, meaning not that the speaker really
has these feelings, but that he is capable of them if he give rein to
his resentment. In the same way velim even on the supposition that
it has a contingent force, might be employed in sentences of a similar
character.

And yet, as a matter of fact, Ι do not believe that velim has
always or even for the most part a contingent meaning. So sar as
the mode is concerned, I 'think it must be held to be potential since
there is no sufficient reason for believing it to be anything else. In
respect to meaning on the other hand, 1 think there is evidence to
show that velim (along with vellem) is indicative rather than potential.
Through some influence it has lost its contingent force, and though
still preserving the subjunctive form it has come, in the vast majority
of cases, to denote an unconditioned wish in whatever construction it
may stand, meaning not “I could or should wish under certain con-
ditions’'‚ but simply ⁴¹1 wisli⁷'.

Before giving the reasons for the view Ι have here indicated, I
wish to point out that the potential meaning of velim can not be
supported by the statement that it is equivalent to the English ‘¹1
should like⁷'. Bennett¹ uses this argument in reply to Morris’ assertion
