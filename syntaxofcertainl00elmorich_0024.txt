Merc. 460: Numquam edepol quisquam illam habebit potiusquam
ille quem ego volo. Ter. Phor. 115: Si uxorem velit, lege id licere
facere. In the latter passage, facere shows that ducere is understood
with velit¹. These passages illustrate the kind of ellipsis that is
assumed by the traditional explanation of the construction in question.

This explanation is also supported by the fact that these ex-
pressions of which te volo is the type as a rule precede some
communication from one person to another. Usually it is from the
speaker to the person addressed, since very few of the cases involve
any form of the verb other than the first person singular. Thus for
example we find Plaut. Curc. 686: Heus tu, leno: te volo and As. 639:
Secede huc, Libane: te volo. Followed by the delivery of the message
from the speaker. From this almost uniform usage, it seems natural
to infer that these formulae had no other purpose than to convey
the idea that some one desires to speak with another, and that a
verb expressing this idea must be supplied.

Then again, the sentence sometimes contains phrases which seem
to point unmistakably to a verb understood. There are four passages
os this kind, viz: Plaut. Epid. 460: Volo te verbis pauculis, si tibi
molestum non est. Mil. 375: Sed paucis verbis te volO. Trin. 963:
Heus, Pax, te tribus verbis volo. Ter. And. 29: Sosia adesdum: paucis
te volo. These phrases would seem to indicate not only that the
force of the omitted verb was clearly felt, but also that we have here
the first step in the transition from the fully expressed idea, such as
we find in Pseud. 245: Mane: em conloqui qui volunt te2.

In spite, however, of the considerations, Ι believe that in most
of these expressions, the pronoun carne to be felt as the direct object
of the main verb. There xvas no doubt a transition, andin the
sentence just quoted it is clear that an omitted verb of speaking was
felt3 but in the remaining instances, Ι think it is likely that such is
not the case. It seems to me that these formulae are broader as a
rule in their meaning than the Commentators suppose. Te volo, for
example, corresponds to the English, “I want you''. In both cases
what is desired and what is meant by the pronounS, is a certain
attitude of subordination on the part of the person addressed. The
latter is desired to present himself in readiness to receive the will of
the speaker. To make this will effective usually involves addressing
some one with whom the speaker is not at the time in conversation,

 

¹ Elmer, Ι think, wrongly takes uxorem as in appositior] with the direct object
earn, which is understood. It will be seen further on how rare this construction is in
Comedy. In Fleckeisen¹s text of Heaut 853, Ita aiunt et illum illam velle uxorein, the
ellipsis of the infinitive should also be assumed.

'-' In Pers. 599 we have percontari hanc paucis hic volt. See also Capt. 53 and
Rud. 120, and the similar construction in Cic. de Or. 2, 156.
