was the source of the difficulty. Resides· this use of eho Seyffert's
conjecture as well as that of Hermann involves the arbitrary insertion
in the text of a word no trace of which cxists in thc Mss. My
remedy for this line is to write cedo for eho. Then, acceptingssothius
change of illac to illaec, a form which according to Schmidt¹ may
stand before either vowels or consonants, we have an anapaestic
septenarius: BA. Soror est quod te volo se'cretO. ΞΟ. Cedo amabo.
NI. Quo illaec abeunt.

The change involved in reading cedo is a very slight one. lt
only the first letter were once dropped, the remaining edo would be
changed by the copyist almost at once to eho, in order to have at
least the semblance of meaning. For cedo in the sense of tell me.
Cf. Ter. Phor. 398: Cedo, qui est cognata, and Plaut. Most. 572:
Quin quid vis cedo. Cf. also Bacch. 3033 Curc. 6463 Mil. 226, 617;
Poen. 865, 8963 Ter. And. 730, Hec. 753; Cato, Frg. 77. Ι
(Cor.); Cic. Part. Or. 3, and other passages which might be cited.
This meaning of “tell me'’ is not so frequent as that of “give rne⁷⁷,
but it is found in about one-fourth of all the cases in Comedy. The
use of the word then in this sense in the passage under consideration
has thus abundant justification.

In treating the object of velle, there has been occasion to
mention the formula numquid me vis of which eleven2 examples were
found, all in Comedy. A more frequent form of the same expression is
with the omission of the personal pronoun, of which about double³
the number of cases occur, two of which are in Cicero’s Letters. In
reference to the formula itself‚ in whichever form it may appear, it
seems to me that there are one or two misapprehensionS, which it
may be worth while to remove.

In the first place, it is not, as it usually said to be, a mere
formula of leave-tal<ing⁴. In some instances, it is true, it seems to
amount to no more than this, in which case the answer is vale or
some equivalent expression. Thus in Plaut.Curc.516 we have: CV. Lyco,
numquid vis? LY. Bene vale, and Ter. Phor. 151: DA. Numquid,
Geta, aliud me vis? GE. Ut bene sit tibi, while in Pers, 693 the
answer takes the form of a question. With these passages cf. Plaut. Cist.
1193 Cure. 522, Merc.325; Pers. 709, 7353 Ter. Phor. 458. But all these
cases taken together are not equal in number to those where the
