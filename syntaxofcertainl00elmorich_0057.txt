Omnia quac opto contingant ut vehementer velim3 9. 9. 3: Qua re
velim ut tu te vel Athenas vel in quietam recipias civitatem3 11.18.3:

Antonius3 12. 14. 4: De nostra dignitate velim tibi ut semper curae
sit. Of the construction with vellem Ι have noted three examples:
Cic. Att. 12. 14. 4: Quod ad te scripsit, id vellem, ut ipse adesset3
Fam. 7. 31. 2: Equidem vellem uti pedes haberent. For mallem the
only example seems to be Cic. Att. Ι. 16. 14: Equidem mallem ut ires.
These caseS, though comparatively few in number are sufficient to
show that the usage was not altogether unknown to Cicero, just as
it was not altogether unknown to the earlier writers.

We are met here by a question concerning the difference in the
meaning of the two constructions. How, for example, does volo or
velim with the simple subjunctive differ from the same form with ut
and the subjunctive? This question also has been answered by
Gildersleeve-Lodgc', who say that “when the idea of wishing is
emphatic, the simple subjunctive without ut is employed, and the
restriction of sequence to Pr. and Imp. is removed”. This statement
taken in connection with their previous one that the potential forms
velim, malim, vellem, and mallem are always used without ut, has
alarming consequences, for it implies that every wish expressed by
the aid of these forms is an emphatic one. In fact considering the
comparatively few cases of ut and the subjunctive with all forms of
velle, nolle and malle, when taken together, one can not but wonder
at the little occasion the Latin writers found for the expression of
unemphatic wishes. Moreovcr, these subjunctives do not all express
wishes3 it is true, that those with the potential forms have this
significance, being usually circumlocutions for the optative subjunctive,
but those with volo and nolo are for the most part strong expressions
of the will. Then again it could be shown that Cicero, who employs
velim with the simple subjunctive with such frequency, often uses this
combination for the expressing of wishes on which there is no reason
to believe that he places any special emphasis, It seems to me
much more reasonable, wherever any form of velle or malle occurs
with ut and the subjunctive, to believe that the usage is due to the
analogy of optare. This, perhaps, can not be proved, but it does
away with the difficulties of the other hypothesis and leaves the two
constructions without any great difference of meaning. Each one no
doubt had special associations for the person who used it·, it is
possible that when ut was employed, volo or velim, for example, was
felt as having a touch of iubeo or opto; but this difference in the
