forent. With nolle the only example is Catull. 682. 38: Nolim
statuas nos mente malqua id facere. For malle cf. Cat. 24. 4: Mallem
divitias Midae dedisses.

These passages together with the table which precedes them
make it clear that only certain forms of velle, nolle and malle are
habitually used with the subjunctive. Others are found only in
sporadic cases, or for special reasons. Thus we find voles and vult
in the examples quoted above. In Cicero volumus, voluit and velle
also appear with a following subjunctive. The three passages are as
follows: Fin. 2. 72: Id volumus, id contendimus, ut officii fructus sit
ipsum officium. Rep. 3. (52 (gua re qui utrumque voluit et potuit, id
est, ut cum maiorum institutis tum doctrina se instrueret, ad laudem
hunc omnia consecutum puto. Tusc. 5. 83: Et quoniam videris hoc
velle ut . . . . virtus satis habeat ad vitam beatam praesidii. In each
of these sentences, the subjunctive clause is a substantive one, standing
in apposition to the object of the verb, and thus having a special
reason for their connection with these forms of velle.

The table also reveals the fact that in Cicero’s orations there are
four cases of velitis with the subjunctive, but these are all in the
formula velitis inbeatisne ut. Outside of this stereotyped expression,
the subjunctive is never found with this form of velle.

A point which deserves attention is the subjunctive with nolle
which occurs only in connection with the forms nolo nolim and
nollem. With nollem, according to Gilde1·sleeve-Lodge¹‚ the sub-
junctive is “theoretically'’ possible, but they imply that no examples
of the actual usage are to be found, and Ι believe none are quoted
by the grammarians. It is true the examples are not numerous, but
at least two are to be found, all in Cicero. They are Fam. 3. IO. 2:
Nollem accidisset tempus in quo vperspicere posses quanti te facerem,
and Sest. 102: Nollem idem alio loco dixisset. These passages in
addition to surnishing actual evidence of the usage might also be
