follows Corsscn in connecting cupere with capere in the sense of a
spiritual layinghold of thingS, takes the sanie general view as Seyffert-
Mueller, as also do Schultz and Shumway. The only authority who
attempts to go into details is Schmidt', who regards cupere as
primarily‚ but not exclusivcly animpulse toward some object connect-
ed with our physical nature or arising out of it, such as the desire
for food and drink and the pleasures of love. In accordance with
this view he takes cupere as corresponding to the German “begehren'‘
(which is used where “die Empfindung, namentlich die leibliche‚ her-
vorragend betheiligt scheint) and to the Greek ἕπιθινμεῖνῖ. However,
Schmidt is careful to say that cupere is not so restricted in its
application as §mt‘lvmtvffl In addition to physical desires, it may
express those higher moral aspiratio11S‚ wherein the agent seeks not
his advantage, but the good os others⁴.

There are two criticisms that may be made on Schmidt's view.
One is that from the point of view of usage he places too much
stress on cupere as a verb of mere physical desire. This may have
been its original sphere, though he offers no proof that such was the
case, but in actual practice its use in this sense is comparatively
rather infrequent‚ and none of the existing examples are quoted by
Schmidt himself. Moreover Schmidt’s classification of the objects of
cupere practically under two heads is inadequate. These objects are
very diverse, and cover a much wider range than Schmidt’s treatment
would lead one to believe.

I have spoken of the comparative infrequency of cupere in the
sphere of physical desires3 it is used of the pleasures os eating in
Plaut. Capt. 463. Ille miserrumust qui, quom esse cupit, quod edit
non habet. In the following places it is used of the pleasures of
love. Plaut. Asin. 647: LE. Vin faciam ut te Philaenium praesente
hoc amplexetur? LI. Cupio hercle. Amph. 132: Cubat complexus,
quoius cupiens maxumest. Mil. 997: Ac dum huc transivit atque
huius cupiens corporist. Trin. 671: Quom inopiast, cupias: quando
eius copiast, tum non velis, Ter. Phor. 166: Ita me di bene ament,
ut mihi liceat tam diu quod amo frui, iam depecisci morte cupio.
Lucret. 4, 1117: Inde redit rabies eadem et furor ille revisit. Cum sibi
quid cupient ipsi contingere quaerunt5.

Another infrequent but interesting use of cupere is in curses and
imprecations‚ or in wishes for harm to another. Cf. As. 900: Quid
