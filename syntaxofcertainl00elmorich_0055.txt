classical period reall)⁷ no warrant sor cupere with a substantive ut
clause. In classical Latin the usage is not so ‹lecisivc though
Gilderslccve-Lodge¹ make the sweeping statement that “in classical
Prose cupere never takes ut''. Bennett2‚ on the other hand, under the
head of Substantive Clauses developed from the optative with verbs
of wishing and desiring, gives as one of his examples‚ cupio ne veniat,
as though the construction were perfectly authenticated. The truth is
that cupere with the subjunctive has only the warrant of two passages
in Cicero, neither of which, on account os the influence of another
verb on the construction is altogether conclusive. The first passage²³
is Att. 2. 18. 4: Tu vellem ego vel cuperem adesses. The other is
Lael. 59: Quin etiam necesse erit cupere et optare ut quam saepissime
peccet amicus. It is possible that adesses in the first example is due
to vellem and ut peccet in the second to optare, but it does not seem
probable that cupio would stand in such a connection if it were not
itself capable of the same construction. Its peculias shade of meaning,
would prevent it from being much used in parataxis, which,
partly at least, accounts for the fact that there is no clear case of
cupere alone with the subjunctive in the Republican period ’ἢ Still I
think that for this period the construction either with or without ut
is a possible one, and was no doubt used whenever the appropriate
idea was to be expressed ⁵.

In comparing the usage of Plautus and Terence with that of Cicero
it is necessary to take into account the special form of the governing
verb with which the subjunctive is used3 in the case os velle, for
example, it is impossible to make a statement concerning the
transition from early to classical Latin that will hold good for the
whole verb. If one confines his attention to the forms volo and nolo
with the subjunctive, he notes in the table that their use is much
greater in Comedy than in Cicero. The same is true of vis with this
construction, which comparatively frequent in the Comic poets is
practically unknown in Cicero. If, however, the compar-ison is made
with the forms velim, vellem and mallem in mind, the usage in Cicero
shows a great increase over that in Comedy. Cicero’s use of velim
with the subjunctive in the Letters is especially striking. A typical
sentence is Att. 8. 12. 5: Accurate velim perscribas tuam ad me
sententiam. It is a mode of expression which hc employs so often

3 Draeger, Hist. Synt. ΙΙ, p. 255, has overlooked this passage saying that cupio ut
occurs “Bei Cicero nur einmal und zwar mit folgenden] optare.''

4 Vergil has a single example, Aen. 10. 442: Cuperem ipse parens spectator
adesset.

5 Desiderare with the subjunctive is found only twice: Cic. Ad. Brut. 1. 10. 1, and·
Off. 2. 39.
